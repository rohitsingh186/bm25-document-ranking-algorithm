scene the Other confers with his master 3 about the failed attack on Earth In a post-credits scene the Avengers eat in silence at a shawarma restaurantRobert Downey Jr as Tony Stark  Iron ManA self-described genius billionaire playboy and philanthropist with an electromechanical suit of armor of his own invention Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios which includes Iron Man 2 and The Avengers 6 Downey said that he initially pushed Whedon to make Stark the lead Well I said I need to be in the opening sequence I dont know what youre thinking but Tony needs to drive this thing He was like Okay lets try that We tried it and it didnt work because this is a different sort of thing the story and the idea and the theme is the theme and everybody is just an arm of the octopus 7 About the characters evolution from previous films Downey said In Iron Man which was an origin story he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts Iron Man 2 is all about not being an island dealing with legacy issues and making space for others   In The Avengers hes throwing it down with the others 8 Chris Evans as Steve Rogers  Captain AmericaA World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films in addition to The Avengers 9 Evans said that Steve Rogers is much darker in The Avengers Its just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world Youve got to imagine its enough of a shock to accept the fact that youre in a completely different time but everybody you know is dead Everybody you cared about   He was a soldier obviously everybody he went to battle with all of his brothers in arms theyre all dead Hes just lonely I think in the beginning its a fish-out-of-water scene and its tough Its a tough pill for him to swallow Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world 7 Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark Evans said I think theres certainly a dichotomythis kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark theyre polar opposites One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along They explore that and its pretty fun 10 Mark Ruffalo as Dr Bruce Banner  HulkA genius scientist who because of exposure to gamma radiation transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated Ruffalo who was considered to play Banner in The Incredible Hulk before Edward Norton took the role 11 was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton broke down 12 About replacing Norton Ruffalo said Im a friend of Eds and yeah that wasnt a great way for all that to go down But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me I look at it as my generations Hamlet About the character he said Hes a guy struggling with two sides of himselfthe dark and the lightand everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk I like that the part has those qualities 13 Regarding the Hulks place on the team Ruffalo said Hes like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team Hes a loose cannon Its like Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and lets hope it turns out well 14 This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk Ruffalo told New York magazine Im really excited No ones ever played the Hulk exactly theyve always done CGI Theyre going to do the Avatar stop-action stop-motion capture So Ill actually play the Hulk Thatll be fun 15 The 3 D model used to create the Hulks body was modeled after Long Island bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm while the Hulks face was modeled after Ruffalo 16 To create the Hulks voice Ruffalos voice was blended with those of Lou Ferrigno and others 17 however the Hulks only speaking line Puny god was provided solely by Ruffalo 18 Chris Hemsworth as ThorThe crown prince of Asgard based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal 19 He had previously worked with Joss Whedon on The Cabin in the Woods 20 Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for Thor by increasing his food intake consisting of chicken breasts fish steak and eggs every day When asked exactly how much Hemsworth said My body weight in protein pretty much 21 He remarked that Thors motivation is much more of a personal one in the sense that its his brother that is stirring things up Whereas everyone else its some bad guy who theyve gotta take down Its a different approach for me or for Thor Hes constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs its his little brother there   Ive been frustrated with my brothers at times or family but Im the only one who is allowed to be angry at them Theres a bit of that 7 Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff  Black WidowA highly trained spy working for SHIELD 22 About the character and her relationship with Hawkeye Johansson said Our characters have a long history Theyve fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries Were the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors  we have no superpowers Black Widow is definitely one of the team though Shes not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy Shes there to fight so I never felt like I was the only girl We all have our various skills and it feels equal 8 Regarding her training Johansson said Even though Iron Man 2 was one-for-them Id never done anything like that before Id never been physically driven in something or a part of something so big For The Avengers Ive spent so many months training with our stunt team and fighting all the other actors its crazy I do nothing but fightall the time 23 Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton  HawkeyeA master archer working as an agent for SHIELD 2425 Renner said it was a very physical role and that he trained physically and practiced archery as much as possible in preparation 26 About the role Renner said When I saw Iron Man I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes Then they told me about this Hawkeye character and I liked how he wasnt really a superhero hes just a guy with a high skill set I could connect to that 8 Regarding Hawkeyes sniper mentality Renner said Its a lonely game Hes an outcast His only connection is to Scarletts character Natasha Its like a left handright hand thing They coexist and you need them both especially when it comes to a physical mission 8 Renner said Hawkeye is not insecure about his humanity Quite the opposite hes the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his tranquilizer-tipped arrows He knows his limitations But when it comes down to it there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero 7 Tom Hiddleston as LokiThors adoptive brother and nemesis based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name 19 About his characters evolution from the film Thor Hiddleston said I think the Loki we see in The Avengers is further advanced You have to ask yourself the question How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making So I think by the time Loki shows up in The Avengers hes seen a few things 27 About Lokis motivations Hiddleston said At the beginning of The Avengers he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king And like all the delusional autocrats of human history he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect so I havent let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation 28 Clark Gregg as Phil CoulsonAn agent with SHIELD who oversees many of the divisions field operations 29 Gregg was cast as part of a multi-picture deal with Marvel 30 Gregg said his role was expanded in The Avengers What Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together it kind of felt a little surreal like somebody was playing a prank and that wasnt the real script But it wasnt it was the real thing I got to show up and do that stuff and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years 31 Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his characters backstory particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America 31 Cobie Smulders as Maria HillA high-ranking agent with SHIELD who works closely with Jacksons Nick Fury 32 Smulders whom Joss Whedon once considered for his unproduced live-action Wonder Woman film was selected from a short list of potential actresses including Morena Baccarin Smulders deal would integrate her into nine films 3334 Regarding her preparation Smulders said I hired this amazing black-ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun take me to a shooting range how to hit how to hold myself how to walk and basically how to look I dont do a ton of fighting in the movie which is why I wasnt offered a trainer but I wanted to look like I had the ability to 35 On relating to the character Smulders said I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full-time and raising a family and having a career Were asked to do a lot of things these days I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going 36 Stellan Skarsgrd as Dr Erik SelvigAn astrophysicist and a friend of Thor under Lokis control who is studying the Tesseracts power 3738 Regarding Lokis control over Selvig Skarsgrd said Well with the scene we did in Thor it was like Loki one way or the other entered Eriks mind And in Avengers you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Eriks mind 38 About his role he said My character is of importance but the size of the role is not big 38 Samuel L Jackson as Nick FuryThe director of SHIELD who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the Avengers Initiative Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films 39 Jackson said he does more in The Avengers than in any of the previous films You dont have to wait until the end of the movie to see me About the role Jackson said Its always good to play somebody who is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative   I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem Jackson compared the character to Ordell in Jackie Brown calling him a nice guy to hang out with You just dont want to cross him 40 Gwyneth Paltrow and Maximiliano Hernndez reprise their roles from previous films as Pepper Potts and Jasper Sitwell respectively Paul Bettany returns to voice JARVIS Frequent Whedon collaborator Alexis Denisof portrays the Other and Damion Poitier portrays his master Thanos unnamed in the film in a

2005 after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures 46 Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts the studios intention was to release individual films for the main charactersto establish their identities and familiarize audiences with thembefore merging the characters together in a crossover film 47 Screenwriter Zak Penn who wrote The Incredible Hulk 2008 was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 200748 In the wake of the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts including Captain America Ant-Man and The Avengers 49 After the successful release of Iron Man 2008 in May the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers 50 In September 2008 Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramountan extension of a previous partnershipwhich gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films 51 Casting began in October 2008 with Downeys signing 6 Though Don Cheadle was also reported to be reprising his Iron Man 2 role of War Machine for The Avengers he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film 652 At the same time two major prospects occurred for Marvel Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film 6 and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget filmsIron Man 2 Thor 2011 and Captain America The First Avenger 2011 at their Manhattan Beach California complex 53 Lou Ferrigno who voiced Hulk in The Incredible Hulk stated that he would be involved in the film 54 In February 2009 Samuel L Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in Iron Man 2 and other films 39 In September 2009 Edward Norton who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk stated that he was open to returning in the film 55 The next month executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film but would definitely have input and a say Favreau also expressed concerns stating Its going to be hard because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero and then with Avengers youre going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor Mixing the two of those works very well in the comic books but its going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that weve created 56 In March 2009 actress Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2 a deal that subsequently attached her to The Avengers 22 The female superhero Wasp was included in an earlier draft of the script written before Johanssons involvement 57 The following day Marvel announced that the films release date had been pushed back to May 4 2012 almost a full year later 58 Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the films cast in June returning as Thor and Loki respectively 19 In July 2009 Penn talked about the crossover process stating My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally were mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected   Theres just a board that tracks Heres where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie   Im pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie to draw boards so that were all working off the same visual ideas But the exigencies of production take first priority 59 In January 2010 Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige was asked if it would be difficult to meld the fantasy of Thor with the high-tech science fiction in Iron Man and The Avengers No he said because were doing the Jack KirbyStan LeeWalt SimonsonJ Michael Straczynski Thor Were not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library Thor And in the Thor of the Marvel Universe theres a race called the Asgardians And were linked through this Tree of Life that were unaware of Its real science but we dont know about it yet The Thor movie is about teaching people that 60 In March it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script and that Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada and Avengers comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis had received copies 61 Also in March Chris Evans accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films including The Avengers 9 By April 2010 Joss Whedon was close to completing a deal to direct the film and to rework Penns script 62 and was officially announced in July 201063 When Whedon received Penns draft he told Feige he felt the studio did not have anything and they should pretend this draft never happened Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film and created the tagline Avengers Some Assembly Required riffing on the Avengers Assemble slogan from the comic books Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki a battle among the heroes in the middle a battle against the villains at the end and he get the movie done for its May 2012 release 64 On the hiring Arad stated My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer Its part of his life so you know he is going to protect it I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better 65 Feige added Ive known Joss for many years We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it we wanted to find a director thats on the verge of doing something great as we think Joss is 66 Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International that what drew him to the film is that he loves how these people shouldnt be in the same room let alone on the same teamand that is the definition of family 67 The casting process continued into much of 2010 with the additions of Jeremy Renner 24 Mark Ruffalo 12 and Clark Gregg 29 Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton who Marvel declined to have back 68 We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers stated Kevin Feige Marvels president of the production team Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble as evidenced by Robert Chris H Chris E Samuel Scarlett and all of our talented casts We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks 69 In response Nortons agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feiges statement calling it purposefully misleading and an inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light 70 In October 2014 Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he wanted more diversity with his career and did not want to be associated with only one character 71 In August 2010 it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February 72 Simultaneously it was declared that the film would be shot in 3 D 73 although Mark Ruffalo later tweeted that this was not the case 74 In October 2010 Grumman Studios in Bethpage New York 75 and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn New York City were announced as filming locations 76 with set construction slated to begin in November 75 but as Whedon later explained Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque 4 Also that October The Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least 115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3 and The Avengers 77 The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8 percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee creditplacement of the companys production logo on marketing materials and the films opening titles As a result the onscreen production credit reads Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures though the film is solely owned distributed financed and marketed by Disney Paramounts Epix retained pay TV rights 78 In December 2010 Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis DEsposito announced The Avengers would film primarily in Albuquerque New Mexico with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011 Parts of the film were also scheduled to be shot in Michigan 79 but a plan to film in Detroit ended after Governor Rick Snyder issued a budget proposal that would eliminate a film tax incentive 80 Three months later in March Governor of Ohio John Kasich announced before Mayor Frank G Jacksons State of the City address that The Avengers would film in Cleveland 81 Concept illustrator and designer of Iron Mans Mark VII armor Phil Saunders stated that Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the cool factor of the suitcase suit from Iron Man 2 while still being a fully armored heavy duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle To that end Saunders borrowed ideas that had been proposed in Iron Man 2 as well as some ideas that had been abandoned in Iron Man and merged them together in a modular suit that has big ammo packets on the arms and a backpack 82 The Science  Entertainment Exchange also provided science consultation for the film 83 Casting reached its final stages the following year In February 2011 Cobie Smulders acquired the role of Maria Hill 34 after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key SHIELD member who Samuel L Jackson described as Nick Furys sidekick 33 Over the successive months the films cast expanded to include Stellan Skarsgrd 37 Paul Bettany 84 and Gwyneth Paltrow 85 Paltrow was cast at Downeys insistence prior to this Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes individual films commenting You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team 86 Principal photography began on April 25 2011 in Albuquerque New Mexico 87 In June 2011 stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after getting hit by an arrow A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZcom that despite the injury Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set 88 The following month secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in the Butler area 89 A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms the worlds largest single-site mushroom farm which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming 90 Production relocated to Cleveland Ohio in August 2011 where filming transpired over a period of four weeks The citys East 9 th Street was chosen as a double for New York Citys 42 nd Street to be used in climactic battle scenes 91 Army Reserve soldiers assigned to the Columbus Ohio-based 391 st Military Police Battalion provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland Staff Sergeant Michael T Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light explaining that Its easy for us to make on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms the director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging 92 Filming also took place in the large vacuum chamber at the NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky Ohio 93 The stations Space Power Facility was used to portray a SHIELD research facility 94 A series of explosions were filmed at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in Parma Ohio as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland 95 Scenes from the film were also shot on Public Square and the DetroitSuperior Bridge 96 Public Squares southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart Germany for filming 97 Principal photography concluded in New York City where filming occurred over two days 98 Filming locations in New York City included Park Avenue and Central Park 99100 For scenes taking place in Manhattan visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates elaborating that his main objective was to get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to see the big expanses the wide establishing shots while also making sure that the effects work doesnt look too computer generated 101 Were getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments Morrison explained but there is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need 101 Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey stated that he composed the frame with a 1851 aspect ratio to cope with the varying heights of the main characters explaining that shooting 1851 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk Captain America and Black Widow who is much smaller We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame Also Joss Whedon knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important 102 The film was McGarveys first venture shooting with a digital camera the Arri Alexa 102 The Canon EOS 5 D Mark II and Canon EOS 7 D digital SLR cameras were used for some shots 103104 and high-speed shots were captured on 35 mm film with the Arriflex 435102 About his visual approach McGarvey remarked Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a comic book look that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images and we chose angles that were dramatic like low angles for heroic imagery 102 Post-productionIn December 2011 Disney announced that the film would be converted to 3 D 105 Said Whedon Im not a big fan of extreme long lens talky movies  I like to see the space Im in and relate to it so 3 D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years Whedon also said that there definitely are movies that shouldnt be in 3 D but The Avengers isnt obnoxiously 3 D Theres no Oh look were going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because its in 3 D And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time But its an action movie Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway 106 In January 2012 it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3 D and open in IMAX theaters on May 4 2012 the same day it opens in regular theaters The films IMAX release follows Marvels IMAX releases of Iron Man 2 and Thor 107 In a May 2012 interview Whedon said that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene although the character is not identified in the film He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain Hes the great grand daddy of the badasses and hes in love with Death and I just think thats so cute For me the greatest Avengers comic book was Avengers Annual 7 1977 that Jim Starlin did followed by Marvel Two-in-One Annual 2 1977 that contained the death of Adam Warlock Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Lokis work and I was like Its got to be Thanos And they said Okay and Im like Oh my God 108 An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12 2012 a day after the world premiere 109 Shawarma sales in Los Angeles St Louis and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the films release 110111112 The film contains more than 2200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies Industrial Light  Magic ILM Weta Digital Scanline VFX Hydraulx Fuel VFX Evil Eye Pictures Luma Pictures Cantina Creative Trixter Modus FX Whiskytree Digital Domain The Third Floor and Method Design ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the films key effects including the Helicarrier the New York cityscape digital body doubles Iron Man and the Hulk To create the on-screen Hulk Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras two full body two focused on his face captured his face and body movements 114 Jeff White ILMs visual effects supervisor said We really wanted to utilize everything weve developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him So much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance not only in motion capture and on set but down to his eyes his teeth and his tongue 115 ILM digitally recreated the vast majority of the New York cityscape used in the film In total ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks To do this ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted 8 weeks 114 Disney and Sony Pictures agreed for OsCorp Tower from The Amazing Spider-Man to be included in the film but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed 116 Weta Digital took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM Guy Williams Wetas visual effects supervisor said We shared assets back and forth with ILM but our pipelines are unique and its hard for other assets to plug into it But in this case we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different 115 Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Mans reflective metal surfaces 114 Scanline VFX completed the reveal shots of the Helicarrier from the moment Black Widow and Captain America arrive on the carrier deck to the point where it lifts off 114 Evil Eye Pictures composited digital backgrounds into shots filmed against a greenscreen for scenes taking place inside the Helicarrier 114 Colin Strause of Hydraulx said We did the opening ten minutes of the movie other than the opening set-up in space including Lokis arrival on Earth and subsequent escape from the SHIELD base 114 Luma Pictures worked on shots featuring the Helicarriers bridge and incorporated the graphic monitor displays that were developed by Cantina Creative 114 Fuel VFX completed shots taking place in and around Tony Starks penthouse at Stark Tower 114 Digital Domain created the asteroid environment where Loki encounters The Other 114 Method Design in Los Angeles created the films closing credits Steve Viola creative director at Method Design said This piece was a two-minute self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG For each of the shots in the sequence we designed modeled textured and lit all of the environments and many of the foreground objects We

Avengers as well as 30 credits set in-scene 115 In November 2011 Marvel announced that Alan Silvestri who scored Captain America The First Avenger would write and compose the score for The Avengers Silvestri said Ive worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and its a very different situation Its very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together 117 Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London England 118 Whedon said The score is very old-fashioned which is why Silvestri was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion the Hans Zimmer school of Im just feeling a lot right now but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific which I love 118 In March 2012 American alternative rock band Soundgarden announced through its Facebook page that its song Live to Rise would be included on

238 Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review of the film remarking Its clamorous the save-the-world story is one everyones seen time and again and the characters have been around for more than half a century in 500 comic book issues But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish however familiar is irresistibly tasty again 239 To Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster Its also the blockbuster Travers said I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny stupendously exciting package Its Transformers with a brain a heart and a working sense of humor 240 Justin Chang of Variety wrote Like a superior state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts Joss Whedons buoyant witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story 241 Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times complimented the films frenetic pace 242 while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that it provides its fans with exactly what they desire Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable 243 Conversely A O Scott of The New York Times believed that while The Avengers is hardly worth raging about its failures are significant and dispiriting The light amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding hectic emptiness the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre 244 The performances of several cast members was a frequent topic in the critiques In particular Mark Ruffalos portrayal of Dr Bruce Bannerthe Hulk was well-received by commentators Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast Ruffalo is the revelation turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano 245 Similarly The New Yorkers Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalos acting to be one of the films highlightsalongside Downey 246 The Village Voices Karina Longworth concluded Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who in contrast to the preening hunks on the team knows better than to draw attention to himself 247 Travers asserted that the actor resonated a scruffy warmth and humor vibe 240 while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character 242 Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that hes at war every moment with himself The film finally solves the Hulk problem Hes a lot more fun in small doses 248 Referring to Downey Joe Morgenstein of The Wall Street Journaldespite complimenting Downeys performancefavored his work in Iron Man over his acting in The Avengers His Iron Man is certainly a team player but Mr Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers a character of established sophisticationthe industrialistinventor Tony Stark a sharp-tongued man of the worldand his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony 249 Neumaier praised Evans stating that he accurately conveyed his characters internal conflicts 245 Commentators appreciated the character development and dialogue Associated Press reviewer Christy Lemire wrote that the script sparkles as brightly as the special effects these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but theyre well fleshed-out underneath 250 Scott suggested that certain parts of the film permeated a charm that he felt was similar to the western film Rio Bravo 1959244 Longworth felt that while Whedons script demonstrated the backstory of the characters the film does not explore it in a substantive way 247 AccoladesMain article List of accolades received by Marvels The AvengersThe Avengers has garnered numerous awards and nominations including an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects
