holding out for something a little bigger Ive been screening it for a lot of groups and people are really responding to it I think theyre scared of that movie 16 About directing he saysI liken it to an actor gets to eat one slice and a director gets to eat the whole pie laughs You get to collaborate with gifted people who are good at their craft so youre orchestrating all these different mediums Youre helping people through the script to realize their own talents I find that really satisfying and I felt like being in front of the camera is so intense and self-involved and personal and directing isnt like that for me Its a much more communal experience Last year at this time I was like Im not going back to acting man No way its done I havent worked in a year Its really taken me that long to get back to my love for what I do for acting I would like to do 50-50 if I could Really Id just be directing right now but I cant support my family doing that at this moment and I love acting
