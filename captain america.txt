Captain America is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby the character first appeared in Captain America Comics 1 cover dated March 1941 from Timely Comics a predecessor of Marvel Comics Captain America was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics most popular character during the wartime period The popularity of superheroes waned following the war and the Captain America comic book was discontinued in 1950 with a short-lived revival in 1953 Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964 Captain America has remained in publicationCaptain America wears a costume that bears an American flag motif and is armed with a nearly indestructible shield that he throws at foes The character is usually depicted as the alter ego of Steve Rogers a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the United States governments imminent efforts in World War II Near the end of the war he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in the present day Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time with its modern realities he remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes becoming the long-time leader of the AvengersCaptain America was the first Marvel Comics character to have appeared in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 movie serial Captain America Since then the character has been featured in other films and television series more recently in the Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU portrayed by Chris Evans in Captain America The First Avenger The Avengers Captain America The Winter Soldier Avengers Age of Ultron and the upcoming film Captain America Civil WarCaptain America is ranked 6 th on IGNs Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time in 20111 second in their list of The Top 50 Avengers in 20122 and second in their Top 25 best Marvel superheroes list in 20143 In 1940 writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume 4 I wrote the name Super American at the bottom of the page Simon said in his autobiography and then consideredNo it didnt work There were too many Supers around Captain America had a good sound to it There werent a lot of captains in comics It was as easy as that The boy companion was simply named Bucky after my friend Bucky Pierson a star on our high school basketball team 5 Simon recalled in his autobiography that Timely Comics publisher Martin Goodman gave him the go-ahead and directed that a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one characters stories Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner artist Jack Kirby could handle the workload aloneI didnt have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue  There were two young artists from Connecticut that had made a strong impression on me Al Avison and Al Gabriele often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other Actually their work was not too far from that of Kirbys If they worked on it and if one inker tied the three styles together I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform The two Als were eager to join in on the new Captain America book but Jack Kirby was visibly upset Youre still number one Jack I assured him Its just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issueIll make the deadline Jack promised Ill pencil it all myself and make the deadline I hadnt expected this kind of reaction  but I acceded to Kirbys wishes and it turned out was lucky that I did There might have been two Als but there was only one Jack Kirby  I wrote the first Captain America book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds Kirby did his thing building the muscular anatomy adding ideas and pepping up the action as only he could Then he tightened up the penciled drawings adding detailed backgrounds faces and figures 5 Al Liederman would ink that first issue which was lettered by Simon and Kirbys regular letterer Howard Ferguson 6 Simon said Captain America was a consciously political creation he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of Nazi Germany in the years leading up to the United States involvement in World War II and felt war was inevitable The opponents to the war were all quite well organized We wanted to have our say too 7 Captain America Comics 1  cover-dated March 19418 and on sale December 20 1940910 a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor but a full year into World War II  showed the protagonist punching Nazi leader Adolf Hitler it sold nearly one million copies 11 While most readers responded favorably to the comic some took objection Simon noted When the first issue came out we got a lot of  threatening letters and hate mail Some people really opposed what Cap stood for 7 The threats which included menacing groups of people loitering out on the street outside of the offices proved so serious that police protection was posted with New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia personally contacting Simon and Kirby to give his support 12 Though preceded as a patriotically themed superhero by MLJs The Shield Captain America immediately became the most prominent and enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in American comic books prior to and during World War II 13 as evidenced by the unusual move at the time of premiering the character in his own title instead of an anthology title first This popularity drew the attention and a complaint from MLJ that the characters triangular shield too closely resembled the chest symbol of their Shield character In response Goodman had Simon and Kirby create a distinctive round shield for issue 2 which went on to become an iconic element of the character 14 With his sidekick Bucky Captain America faced Nazis Japanese and other threats to wartime America and the Allies Stanley Lieber now better known as Stan Lee contributed to the character in issue 3 in the filler text story Captain America Foils the Traitors Revenge which introduced the characters use of his shield as a returning throwing weapon 15 Captain America soon became Timelys most popular character and even had a fan-club called the Sentinels of Liberty 7 Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines such as Time during the period 1316 After the Simon and Kirby team moved to DC Comics in late 1941 having produced Captain America Comics through issue 10 January 1942 Al Avison and Syd Shores became regular pencillers of the celebrated title with one generally inking over the other The

as All-New Captain America 52 Legal statuseditIn 1966 Joe Simon sued the owners of Marvel Comics asserting that he  not Marvel  was legally entitled to renew the copyright upon the expiration of the original 28-year term The two parties settled out of court with Simon agreeing to a statement that the character had been created under terms of employment by the publisher and therefore it was work for hire owned by them 53 In 1999 Simon filed to claim the copyright to Captain America under a provision of the Copyright Act of 1976 which allowed the original creators of works that had been sold to corporations to reclaim them after the original 56-year copyright term but not the longer term enacted by the new legislation had expired Marvel Entertainment challenged the claim arguing that the settlement of Simons 1966 suit made the character ineligible for termination of the copyright transfer Simon and Marvel settled out of court in 2003 in a deal that paid Simon royalties for merchandising and licensing use of the character 5354 Steven Rogers was born in the 1920 s in the Lower East Side of Manhattan New York City to poor Irish immigrants Sarah and Joseph Rogers 55 Joseph died when Steve was a child and Sarah died of pneumonia while Steve was a teen By early 1940 before Americas entry into World War II Rogers is a tall scrawny fine arts student specializing in illustration and a comic book writer and artistDisturbed by the rise of the Third Reich Rogers attempts to enlist but is rejected due to his frail body His resolution attracts the notice of US Army General Chester Phillips and Project Rebirth Rogers is used as a test subject for the Super-Soldier project receiving a special serum made by Dr Josef Reinstein 5657 later retroactively changed to a code name for the scientist Abraham Erskine 58 The name Erskine was first used in a Captain America novel The Great Gold Steal by Ted White published by Bantam Books in 1968 The serum is a success and transforms Steve Rogers into a nearly perfect human being with peak strength agility stamina and intelligence The success of the program leaves Erskine wondering about replicating the experiment on other human beings 57 The process itself has been inconsistently detailed while in the original material Rogers is shown receiving injections of the Super-Serum when the origin was retold in the 1960 s the Comic Code Authority had already put a veto over graphic description of drug intake and abuse and thus the Super-Serum was retconned into an oral formula 59 Later accounts hint at a combination of oral and intravenous treatments with a strenuous training regimen culminating in the Vita-Ray exposureErskine refused to write down every crucial element of the treatment leaving behind a flawed imperfect knowledge of the steps Thus when the Nazi spy Heinz Kruger killed him Erskines method of creating new Super-Soldiers died Captain America in his first act after his transformation avenges Erskine In the 1941 origin story and in Tales of Suspense 63 Kruger dies when running into machinery but is not killed by Rogers in the Captain America 109 and 255 revisions Rogers causes the spys death by punching him into machinery 57 Unable to create new Super-Soldiers and willing to hide the Project Rebirth fiasco the American government casts Rogers as a patriotic superhero able to counter the menace of the Red Skull as a counter-intelligence agent He is supplied with a patriotic uniform of his own design 55 a bulletproof shield a personal side arm and the codename Captain America while posing as a clumsy infantry private at Camp Lehigh in Virginia He forms a friendship with the camps teenage mascot James Buchanan Bucky Barnes 56 Barnes learns of Rogers dual identity and offers to keep the secret if he can become Captain Americas sidekick During their adventures Franklin D Roosevelt presents Captain America with a new shield forged from an alloy of steel and vibranium fused by an unknown catalyst so effective that it replaces his own firearm 58 Throughout World War II Captain America and Bucky fight the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team the Invaders as seen in the 1970 s comic of the same name 60 Captain America fights in numerous battles in WWII primarily as a member of 1 st Battalion 26 th Infantry Regiment Blue Spaders 61 Captain America battles a number of criminal menaces on American soil including a wide variety of costumed villains the Wax Man 62 the Hangman 63 the Fang 64 the Black Talon 65 and the White Death 66 among othersIn addition to Bucky Captain America was occasionally assisted by the Sentinels of Liberty 67 Sentinels of Liberty was the title given to members of the Captain America Comics fan club who Captain America sometimes addressed as an aside or as characters in the Captain America Comics storiesIn late April 1945 during the closing days of World War II Captain America and Bucky try to stop the villainous Baron Zemo from destroying an experimental drone plane Zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive on it with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit The pair reaches the plane just before take off When Bucky tries to defuse the bomb it explodes in mid-air Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic Both are presumed dead though it is later revealed that neither one died 68 Late 1940 s to 1950 seditCaptain America appeared in comics for the next few years changing from World War II-era hero fighting the Nazis to confronting the United States newest enemy Communism The revival of the character in the mid-1950 s was short-lived and events during that time period are later retconned to show that multiple people operated using the code name to explain the changes in the character These post World War II successors are listed as William Naslund and Jeffrey MaceThe last of these other official Captains William Burnside 69 was a history graduate enamored with the Captain America mythos having his appearance surgically altered to resemble Rogers and legally changing his name to Steve Rogers becoming the new 1950 s Captain America 70 He self-administered to himself and his pupil James Jack Monroe a flawed incomplete copy of the Super-Serum which made no mention about the necessary Vita-Ray portion of the treatment As a result while Burnside and Monroe became the new Captain America and Bucky they became violently paranoid often raving about innocent people being communist sympathizers during the height of the Red Scare of the 1950 s Their insanity forced the US government to place them in indefinite cryogenic storage until they could be cured of their mental illness 71 Monroe would later be cured and assume the Nomad identity 72 Years later the superhero team the Avengers discovers Steve Rogers body in the North Atlantic After he revives they piece together that Rogers has been preserved in a block of ice since 1945 surviving because of his enhancements from Project Rebirth The block began to melt after the Sub-Mariner enraged that an Inuit tribe is worshipping the frozen figure throws it into the ocean 68 Rogers accepts membership in the Avengers and his experience in individual combat service and his time with the Invaders makes him a valuable asset He quickly assumes leadership 73 and has typically returned to that position throughout the teams historyCaptain America is plagued by guilt for having been unable to prevent Buckys death Although he takes the young Rick Jones who closely resembles Bucky under his tutelage he refuses for some time to allow Jones to take up the Bucky identity not wishing to be responsible for another youths death Insisting that his hero move on from that loss Jones convinces Rogers to let him don the Bucky costume 74 but this partnership lasts only a short time a disguised Red Skull impersonating Rogers with the help of the Cosmic Cube drives Jones awayRogers reunites with his old war comrade Nick Fury who is similarly well-preserved due to the Infinity Formula As a result Rogers regularly undertakes missions for the security agency SHIELD for which Fury is public director 75 Through Fury Rogers befriends Sharon Carter a SHIELD agent 76 with whom he eventually begins a romantic relationshipRogers later meets and trains Sam Wilson who becomes the superhero the Falcon 77 the first African-American superhero in mainstream comic books 7879 The characters established an enduring friendship and adventuring partnership sharing the series title for some time as Captain America and the Falcon 25 The two later encounter the revived but still insane 1950 s Captain America 7071808182 Although Rogers and the Falcon defeat the faux Rogers and Jack Monroe Rogers becomes deeply disturbed that he could have suffered his counterparts fate During this period Rogers temporarily gains super strength 83 The series dealt with the Marvel Universes version of the Watergate scandal 848586 making Rogers so uncertain about his role that he abandons his Captain America identity in favor of one called Nomad 87 emphasizing the words meaning as man without a country During this time several men unsuccessfully assume the Captain America identity 88 Rogers eventually re-assumes it after coming to consider that the identity could be a symbol of American ideals and not its government its a personal conviction epitomized when he later confronted a corrupt Army officer attempting to manipulate him by appealing to his loyalty Im loyal to nothing General  except the American Dream Jack Monroe cured of his mental instability later takes up the Nomad alias 89 Sharon Carter is believed to have been killed while under the mind control of Dr Faustus 90 The 1980 s included a run by writer Roger Stern and artist John Byrne Stern had Rogers consider a run for President of the United States in Captain America 250 June 198091 an idea originally developed by Roger McKenzie and Don Perlin Stern in his capacity as editor of the title originally rejected the idea but later changed his mind about the concept 9293 McKenzie and Perlin received credit for the idea on the letters page at Sterns insistence 94 Stern additionally introduced a new love interest law student Bernie Rosenthal in Captain America 248 Aug 198095 Writer J M DeMatteis revealed the true face and full origin of the Red Skull in Captain America 298-300 and had Captain America take on Jack Monroe Nomad as a partner for a time 89 Around this time the heroes gathered by the Beyonder elect Rogers as leader during their stay on Battleworld in the 1984 miniseries Secret Wars Homophobia is dealt with as Rogers runs into a childhood friend named Arnold Roth who is gay 9697 Mark Gruenwald became the writer of the series with issue 307 July 1985 and wrote 137 issues for 10 consecutive years from until 443 Sept 199598 the most issues by any single author in

alias of the Captain 107 A replacement Captain America John Walker struggles to emulate Rogers ideals until pressure from hidden enemies helps to drive Walker insane Rogers returns to the Captain America identity 108 while a recovered Walker becomes the US Agent 109 Sometime afterward Rogers avoids the explosion of a methamphetamine lab but the drug triggers a chemical reaction in the Super-Soldier serum in his system To combat the reaction Rogers has the serum removed from his body and trains constantly to maintain his physical condition 110 A retcon later establishes that the serum was not a drug per se which would have metabolized out of his system but in fact a virus-like organism that effected a biochemical and genetic change This additionally explained how nemesis the Red Skull who at the time inhabited a body cloned from Rogers cells has the formula in his bodyBecause of his altered biochemistry Rogers body begins to deteriorate and for a time he must wear a powered exoskeleton and is eventually placed again in suspended animation During this time he is given a transfusion of blood from the Red Skull which cures his condition and stabilizes the Super-Soldier virus in his system Captain America returns to crime fighting and the Avengers 111112 Following Gruenwalds departure from the series Mark Waid took over and resurrected Sharon Carter as

superhuman powers but through the Super-Soldier Serum and Vita-Ray treatment he is transformed and his strength endurance agility speed reflexes durability and healing are at the zenith of natural human potential Rogers body regularly replenishes the super-soldier serum it does not wear off 110 The formula enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in his muscles giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats including bench pressing 1200 pounds 545 kg and running a mile 16 km in 73 seconds 49 mph 78 kph 136 Furthermore his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus 137 The secrets of creating a super-soldier were lost with the death of its creator Dr Abraham Erskine 59 In the ensuing decades there have been numerous attempts to recreate Erskines treatment only to have them end in failure Even worse the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which Captain Americas 1950 s imitator and Nuke are the most notorious examplesRogers battle experience and training make him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle Thor has stated that Rogers is one of the very few humans he will take orders from and follow through the gates of Hades 138 Rogers reflexes and senses are extraordinarily keen He has blended judo western boxing kickboxing and gymnastics into his own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts Years of practice with his near-indestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a boomerang-like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind In canon he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best hand-to-hand combatants in the Marvel Universe limited only by his human physique 139140 Although the super-soldier serum is an important part of his strength Rogers has shown himself still sufficiently capable against stronger opponents even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his pre-Captain America physique 141 Rogers has vast US military knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing classified Defense Department operations He is an expert in combat strategy survival acrobatics military strategy piloting and demolitions Despite his high profile as one of the worlds most popular and recognizable superheroes Rogers has a broad understanding of the espionage community largely through his ongoing relationship with SHIELD He is a talented artist and has worked on the Captain America comic book published in the Marvel universe Other career fields include commercial arts teaching high school history and law enforcementAlthough he lacks superhuman strength Captain America is one of the few mortal beings who has been deemed worthy enough to wield Thors hammer Mjolnir 142 Captain America has used multiple shields throughout his history the most prevalent of which is a nigh-indestructible disc-shaped shield made from an experimental alloy of steel and the fictional vibranium 143144 The shield was cast by American metallurgist Dr Myron MacLain who was contracted by the US government from orders of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II 143 This alloy was created by accident and never duplicated although efforts to reverse-engineer it resulted in the discovery of adamantium 145 Captain America often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon The first instance of Captain Americas trademark ricocheting shield-toss occurs in Stan Lees first comics writing the two-page text story Captain America Foils the Traitors Revenge in Captain America Comics 3 May 194115 The legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the time-traveling mutant superhero Cable telling Captain America that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures Cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbol 146 When without his trademark shield Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel 147 or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix 148 Rogers having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease 149 Much like his vibranium shield the energy shield can be thrown including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand 150 Captain Americas uniform is made of a fire-retardant material and he wears a lightweight bulletproof duralumin scale armor beneath his uniform for added protection 58 Originally Rogers mask was a separate piece of material but an early engagement had it dislodged thus almost exposing his identity To prevent a recurrence of the situation Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck As a member of the Avengers Rogers has an Avengers priority card which serves as a communications deviceCaptain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle modified by the SHIELD weapons laboratory as well as a custom-built battle van constructed by the Wakanda Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes red white and blue and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it
