he becomes Hulk is the alter ego of Bruce Banner a socially withdrawn and emotionally reserved physicist who physically transforms into the Hulk under emotional stress and other specific circumstances at will or against it these involuntary transformations lead to many complications in Banners life When transformed the Hulk often acts as a disassociated personality separate from Banner Over the decades of Hulk stories the Hulk has been represented with several personalities based on Hulk and Banners fractured psyche ranging from mindless savage to brilliant warrior and Banner has taken control of the Hulks form on occasion Banner first transforms into the Hulk after being caught in the blast of the gamma bomb he invented while saving Rick Jones a youth who had wandered onto the testing rangeLee said that the Hulks creation was inspired by a combination of Frankenstein and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde 5 Although the Hulks coloration has varied throughout the characters publication history the most usual color is green As a child Banners father Brian Banner often got mad and physically abused his mother Rebecca creating the psychological complex of fear anger and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the character A common storyline is the pursuit of both Banner and the Hulk by the US armed forces because of all the destruction that he causes He has two main catchphrases Hulk is strongest one there is and the better-known HULK SMASH which has founded the basis for numerous pop culture memesThe character has been portrayed in multiple media features by different actors Hulk was first portrayed in film played by Eric Bana in Ang Lees Hulk 2003 Subsequently the character has been portrayed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe initially by Edward Norton in The Incredible Hulk 2008 and by Mark Ruffalo in The Avengers 2012 and Avengers Age of Ultron 2015 as well as Thor Ragnarok 2017 and both parts of Avengers Infinity War 20182019 In 2011 the Hulk placed No 9 on IGNs list of Top 100 Comic Book Heroes 6 and fourth in their list of The Top 50 Avengers in 20127 The Hulk first appeared in The Incredible Hulk 1 cover dated May 1962 written by writer-editor Stan Lee penciled and co-plotted by Jack Kirby 8 and inked by Paul Reinman Lee cites influence from Frankenstein 9 and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the Hulks creationIt was patently apparent that the monstrous character the Thing was the most popular character in Marvels recently created superhero team the Fantastic Four For a long time Id been aware of the fact that people were more likely to favor someone who was less than perfect Its a safe bet that you remember Quasimodo but how easily can you name any of the heroic handsomer more glamorous characters in The Hunchback of Notre Dame And then theres Frankenstein Ive always had a soft spot in my heart for the Frankenstein monster No one could ever convince me that he was the bad guy He never wanted to hurt anyone he merely groped his torturous way through a second life trying to defend himself trying to come to terms with those who sought to destroy him  I decided I might as well borrow from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde as well  our protagonist would constantly change from his normal identity to his superhuman alter ego and back again 10 Kirby commenting upon his influences in drawing the character recalled as inspiration the tale of a mother who rescues her child who is trapped beneath a car 11 Lee has also compared Hulk to the Golem of Jewish mythology 9 In The Science of Superheroes Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War 12 and the threat of nuclear attack an interpretation shared by Weinstein in Up Up and Oy Vey 9 This interpretation corresponds with other popularized fictional media created during this time period which took advantage of the prevailing sense among Americans that nuclear power could produce monsters and mutants 13 In the debut Lee chose grey for the Hulk because he wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group 14 Colorist Stan Goldberg however had problems with the grey coloring resulting in different shades of grey and even green in the issue After seeing the first published issue Lee chose to change the skin color to green 15 Green was used in retellings of the origin with even reprints of the original story being recolored for the next two decades until The Incredible Hulk vol 2 302 December 1984 reintroduced the grey Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story Since then reprints of the first issue have displayed the original grey coloring with the fictional canon specifying that the Hulks skin had initially been grey An exception is the early trade paperback Origins of Marvel Comics from 1974 which explains the difficulties in keeping the grey color consistent in a Stan Lee written prologue and reprints the origin story keeping the grey colorationLee gave the Hulks alter ego the alliterative name Bruce Banner because he found he had less difficulty remembering alliterative names Despite this in later stories he misremembered the characters name and referred to him as Bob Banner an error which readers quickly picked up on 16 The discrepancy was resolved by giving the character the official full name of Robert Bruce BannerThe Hulks original series was canceled with issue 6 March 1963 Lee had written each story with Kirby penciling the first five issues and Steve Ditko penciling and inking the sixth The character immediately guest-starred in The Fantastic Four 12 March 1963 and months later became a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers appearing in the first two issues of the teams eponymous series Sept and Nov 1963 and returning as an antagonist in issue 3 and as an ally in 5 JanMay 1964 He then guest-starred in Fantastic Four 2526 AprilMay 1964 which revealed Banners full name as Robert Bruce Banner and The Amazing Spider-Man 14 July 196417 Around this time co-creator Kirby received a letter from a college dormitory stating the Hulk had been chosen as its official mascot 9 Kirby and Lee realized their character had found an audience in college-age readersA year and a half after The Incredible Hulk was canceled the Hulk became one of two features in Tales to Astonish beginning in issue 60 Oct 196418 This new Hulk feature was initially scripted by Lee with pencils by Steve Ditko and inks by George Roussos Other artists later in this run included Jack Kirby 6887 June 1965  Oct 1966 Gil Kane credited as Scott Edwards 76 Feb

second title The Rampaging Hulk a black-and-white comics magazine 5 This was originally conceived as a flashback series set between the end of his original short-lived solo title and the beginning of his feature in Tales to Astonish 22 After nine issues the magazine was retitled The Hulk and printed in color 23 In 1977 two Hulk television films were aired to strong ratings leading to an Incredible Hulk TV series which aired from 1978 to 1982 A huge ratings success the series introduced the popular Hulk catchphrase Dont make me angry You wouldnt like me when Im angry and broadened the characters popularity from a niche comic book readership into the mainstream consciousness 24 Bill Mantlo became the series writer for five years beginning with issue 245 March 1980 Mantlos Crossroads of Eternity stories 300313 Oct 1984  Nov 1985 explored the idea that Banner had suffered child abuse Later Hulk writers Peter David and Greg Pak have called these stories an influence on their approaches to the character 2526 Mantlo left the series for Alpha Flight and that series writer John Byrne took over The Incredible Hulk 27 The final issue of Byrnes six issue run featured the wedding of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross 28 Writer Peter David began a twelve-year run with issue 331 May 1987 He returned to the Roger Stern and Mantlo abuse storylines expanding the damage caused and depicting Banner as suffering dissociative identity disorder DID 5 In 1998 David killed off Banners long-time love Betty Ross Marvel executives used Ross death as an opportunity to pursue the return of the Savage Hulk David disagreed leading to his parting ways with Marvel 29 Also in 1998 Marvel relaunched The Rampaging Hulk as a standard comic book rather than as a comics magazine 5 The Incredible Hulk was again

into a trench to save him but is himself hit with the blast absorbing massive amounts of gamma radiation He awakens later in an infirmary seeming relatively unscathed but that night transforms into a lumbering grey form that breaks through the wall and escapes A soldier in the ensuing search party dubs the otherwise unidentified creature a hulk 41 The original incarnation of Banner transformed into the Hulk at sunset and reverted at sunrise Banner was cured in The Incredible Hulk 4 but chose to restore Hulks powers with Banners intelligence The gamma-ray machine needed to affect the transformation-induced side effects that made Banner temporarily sick and weak when returned to his normal stateIn The Avengers 1 September 1963 the Hulk became a founding member of the titles eponymous superhero team However by The Avengers 3 overuse of the gamma ray machine rendered the Hulk as an uncontrollable rampaging monster subject to spontaneous changing In Tales to Astonish 59 September 1964 the Hulk appeared as an antagonist for Giant-Man The series established stress as the trigger for Banner turning into the Hulk and vice versa 42 It was during this time that the Hulk developed a more savage and childlike personality shifting from the brutish figure who spoke in complete sentences and his memory both long-term and short-term was markedly impaired in his Hulk state In Tales to Astonish 77 March 1966 Banners and the Hulks dual identity became publicly known when Glenn Talbot Banners romantic rival for Betty Ross witnessed his transformation turning Banner into a wanted fugitiveThe 1970 s saw Banner and Betty nearly marry in The Incredible Hulk 124 Feb 197043 Betty ultimately married Talbot in issue 158 Dec 197244 Hulk also traveled to other dimensions one of which had him meet empress Jarella who used magic to bring Banners intelligence to Hulk and came to love him Hulk helped to form the Defenders 45 In the 1980 s Banner finally married Betty in The Incredible Hulk 319 May 1986 following Talbots death in 19812846 It was also established that Banner had serious mental problems even before he became the Hulk having suffered childhood traumas that

the Hulkbusters a government team dedicated to catching Hulk Banner and Hulk were reunited in The Incredible Hulk 323 Sep 198650 and with issue 324 returned the Hulk to his grey coloration with his transformations once again occurring at night regardless of Banners emotional state In issue 347 the grey Hulk persona Joe Fixit was introduced a morally ambiguous Las Vegas enforcer and tough guy Banner remained repressed in Hulks mind for months but slowly began to reappearThe 1990 s saw the Green Hulk return 51 In issue 377 Jan 1991 the Hulk was revamped in a storyline that saw the personalities of Banner Grey Hulk and Savage Hulk confront Banners past abuse at the hands of his father Brian and a new Guilt Hulk persona Overcoming the trauma the intelligent Banner cunning Grey Hulk and powerful Savage Hulk personalities merge into a new single entity possessing the traits of all three The Hulk also joined the Pantheon a secretive organization of superpowered individuals 5253 His tenure with the organization brought Hulk into conflict with a tyrannical alternate future version of himself called the Maestro in the 1993 Future Imperfect miniseries who rules over a world where many heroes are deadIn 2000 Banner and the three Hulks Savage Hulk Grey Hulk and the Merged Hulk now considered a separate personality and referred to as the Professor become able to mentally interact with one another each personality taking over the shared body as Banner began to weaken due to his suffering from Lou Gehrigs disease During this the four personalities including Banner confronted yet another submerged personality a sadistic Devil intent on attacking the world and attempting to break out of Banners fracturing psyche but the Devil was eventually locked away again when the Leader was able to devise a cure for the disease using genes taken from the corpse of Brian Banner 33 In 2005 it is revealed that the supernatural character Nightmare has manipulated the Hulk for years and it is implied that some or all of the Hulks adventures written by Bruce Jones may have been just illusion 54 In 2006 the Illuminati decide the Hulk is too dangerous to remain on Earth and send him away by rocket ship which crashes on Planet Sakaar ushering in the Planet Hulk storyline that saw Hulk find allies in the Warbound and marry alien queen Caiera a relationship that was later revealed to have born him two sons Skaar and Hiro-Kala After the Illuminatis ship explodes and kills Caiera Hulk returns to Earth with his superhero group Warbound and declares war on the planet in World War Hulk 2007 In the 2010 s Hiro-Kala traveled to Earth to destroy the OldStrong Power wielded by Skaar forcing Skaar and the Hulk to defeat and imprison him within his home planet 55 Banner also willingly joined the spy organization SHIELD allowing them to use Hulk as a weapon in exchange for providing him with the means and funding to create a lasting legacy for himself 56 After Hulk had suffered brain damage upon being shot in the head by the Order of the Shield Iron Man used the Extremis to cure Hulk 57 This procedure also increased Banners mental capacity which gave him the intelligence to tweak the Extremis virus within him and unleash a new persona for the Hulk the super-intelligent Doc Green With his newfound intellect Doc Green came to the conclusion that the world was in danger by Gamma Mutates and thus needed to be depowered He developed a serum made from Adamantium nanobites that absorbed gamma energy 58 During the Fear Itself storyline Hulk finds one of the Serpents magical hammers and becomes Nul Breaker of Worlds Rampaging through South and Central America Nul was eventually transported to New York City where he began battling a lonesome Thor with aid of the Thing who was transformed into Angrir Breaker of Souls After defeating the Thing Thor stated that he never could beat the Hulk and instead removed him from the battle by launching him into Earth orbit after which Thor collapsed from exhaustion 59 Landing in Romania Nul immediately began heading for the base of the vampire-king Dracula Opposed by Draculas forces including a legion of monsters Nul was seemingly unstoppable 60 Only after the intervention of Raizo Kodos Forgiven was Nul briefly slowed 61 Ultimately Nul made his way to Draculas castle where the timely arrival of Kodo and Forgiven member Inka disguised as Betty Ross was able to throw off the effects of the Nul possession Throwing aside the hammer the Hulk regained control and promptly left upon realizing Bettys true nature 62 Claiming that he wanted to be alone Hulk separated himself from Banner and went to ask Doctor Strange for help to stop NulDuring the Original Sin storyline Bruce Banner confronted by the eye of the murdered Uatu the Watcher Bruce temporarily experienced some of Tony Starks memories of their first meeting before either of them became the Hulk or Iron Man During this vision Bruce witnessed Tony modifying the gamma bomb to be more effective prompting Bruce to realize that Tony was essentially responsible for him becoming the Hulk in the first place 63 Subsequent research reveals that Tonys tampering had actually refined the bombs explosive potential so that it would not disintegrate everyone within the blast radius with the result that Tonys actions had actually saved Bruces life 64 In the wake of the conclusion of World War Hate as seen in the AXIS storyline when a mistake made by the Scarlet Witch caused various heroes and villains to experience a moral inversion Bruce Banner attended a meeting between Nick Fury Jr and Maria Hill of SHIELD and the Avengers who refused to turn over Red Skull Later when he sided with Edwin Jarvis and tried to prevent his teammates from executing Red Skull the Hulk was thrown aside by Luke Cage Hulks sorrow at his friends betrayal awakened a new persona known as the bloodthirsty Kluh described as the Hulks Hulk being the ruthless part of himself that even the Hulk repressed with this new version easily defeating the Avengers sneering that the Hulk they knew was nothing more than a sad piece of Doc Greens ID Kluh then leaves to wreak havoc 65 with Nova attempting to stop him after witnessing his rampage with the remaining good heroes 66 During the Secret Wars storyline Hulks Doc Green form took part in the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610 Hulks Doc Green form used the Fastball Special with Colossus to destroy the Triskelion 67 During his decades of publication Banner has been portrayed differently but common themes persist Banner a medical doctor and a physicist is sarcastic and seemingly very self-assured when he first appears in Incredible Hulk 1 but is also emotionally withdrawn in most fashions 5 Banner designed the gamma bomb which caused his affliction and the ironic twist of his self-inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes 9 Arie Kaplan describes the character thus Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic always wary that the monster inside him will erupt and therefore he cant form meaningful bonds with anyone 68 As a child Banners father Brian often got mad and physically abused both Banner and his mother creating the psychological complex of fear anger and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the characterHis fractured personality led to transformations into different versions of the Hulk These transformations are usually involuntary and often writers have tied the transformation to emotional triggers such as rage and fear Writers have adapted the Hulk changing Hulks personality to reflect changes in Banners physiology or psyche Banner has been shown to be emotionally repressed but capable of deep love for Betty Ross and for solving problems posed to him Under the writing of Paul Jenkins Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him On the occasions that Banner has controlled the Hulks body he has applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the Red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed When he was briefly separated from the Hulk by Doom Banner became criminally insane driven by his desire to regain the power of the Hulk but once the two recombined he came to accept that he was a better person with the Hulk to provide something for him to focus on controlling rather than allowing his intellect to run without restraint against the world 69 The original version of Hulk was often shown as simple and quick to anger 70 The Hulk generally divorces his identity from Banners decrying Banner as that puny weakling in the picture 41 From his earliest stories the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet 9 and often is shown reacting emotionally to situations quickly Grest and Weinberg call Hulk the dark primordial side of Banners psyche 12 Even in the earliest appearances Hulk spoke in the third person Hulk retains a modest intelligence thinking and talking in full sentences and Lee even gives the Hulk expository dialogue in issue six allowing readers to learn just what capabilities Hulk has when the Hulk says But these muscles aint just for show All I gotta do is spring up and just keep goinIn the 1970 s Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage and less talkative Writers played with the nature of his transformations 71 briefly giving Banner control over the change and the ability to maintain control of his Hulk formArtistically and conceptually the character has become progressively more muscular and powerful in the years since his debut 72 Originally Stan Lee wanted the Hulk to be grey but due to ink problems Hulks color was changed to green This was later followed up by the fact that the Grey Hulk and the Savage Hulk are fighting for control in Bruces subconscious The Grey Hulk incarnation can do all the not so nice things that Bruce Banner could not bring himself to do himself While the Grey Hulk still had the madder he gets the stronger he gets part that is similar to the Savage Hulk it is on a much slower rate It is said by Leader that the Grey Hulk is stronger on nights of the New Moon and weaker on nights of the Full Moon Originally the night is when Bruce Banner becomes the Grey Hulk and changes back by dawn In later comics willpower or stress would have Bruce Banner turn into the Grey Hulk 73 The Merged Hulk is the merging of the personalities of Bruce Banner Savage Hulk and Grey Hulk where it has the face of Bruce Banner The Merged Hulk was far more well-adjusted than most incarnations The Merged Hulk is the largest of the three primary Hulk incarnations and has a higher base line While in a calm emotional state the Merged Hulk is stronger than Savage Hulk when he is calm Unlike the Savage Hulk and the Grey Hulk Bruce Banner subconsciously installed a type of safeguard within this incarnation 74 Banner is considered one of the greatest scientific minds on Earth possessing a mind so brilliant it cannot be measured on any known intelligence test 75 He holds expertise in biology chemistry engineering physiology and nuclear physics Using this knowledge Banner creates advanced technology dubbed Bannertech which is on par with technological development from Tony Stark or Doctor Doom Some of these technologies include a force field that can protect him from the attacks of Hulk-level entities and a teleporterThe Hulk possesses the potential for immense and seemingly limitless physical strength depending directly on his emotional state particularly his anger 76 This has been reflected in the repeated comment The madder Hulk gets the stronger Hulk gets The cosmically-powerful entity known as the Beyonder once analyzed the Hulks physiology and claimed that the Hulks potential strength had no finite element inside 77 Hulks strength has been depicted as sometimes limited by Banners subconscious influence when Jean Grey psionically shut Banner off Hulk became strong enough to overpower and destroy the physical form of the villain Onslaught 78 Writer Greg Pak described the Worldbreaker Hulk shown during World War Hulk as having a level of physical power where Hulk was stronger than any mortaland most immortalswho ever walked the Earth 79 His strength allows him to leap into lower Earth orbit or across continents 8081 and he has displayed superhuman speed 8283 His durability regeneration and endurance also increase in proportion to his temper 84 Hulk is resistant to injury or damage though the degree to which varies between interpretations but he has withstood the equivalent of solar temperatures 8586 nuclear explosions 82878889 and planet-shattering impacts 909192 Despite his remarkable resiliency continuous barrages of high-caliber gunfire can hinder his movement to some degree while he can be temporarily subdued with intense attacks with chemical weapons such as anesthetic gases although any interruption of such dosages will allow him to quickly recover 93 He has been shown to have both regenerative and adaptive healing abilities including growing tissues to allow him to breathe underwater 94 surviving unprotected in space for extended periods 95 and when injured healing from most wounds within seconds including on one occasion the complete destruction of most of his body mass 9697 As an effect he has an extremely prolonged lifespan 98 He also possesses less commonly described powers including abilities allowing him to home in to his place of origin in New Mexico 99 resist psychic control 100101102103 or unwilling transformation 104105106 grow stronger from radiation 8889107108109 or dark magic 110111 punch his way between separate temporal 112113 or spatial 114 dimensions and to see and interact with astral forms 111115 Some of these abilities were in later years explained as being related his ability to home in on the New Mexico bomb site was due to his latent ability to sense astral forms and spirits since the bomb site was also the place where the Maestros skeleton was and Maestros spirit was calling out to him in order to absorb his radiation 97 The Hulk is also able to generate omnidirectional bursts of kinetic energy that are powerful enough to completely destroy the planet he is standing on 109116 In the first Hulk comic series massive doses of gamma rays would cause the Hulk to transform back to Banner although this ability was written out of the character by the 1970 sOver the long publication history of the Hulks adventures many recurring characters have featured prominently including his best friend and sidekick Rick Jones love interest and wife Betty Ross and her father the often adversarial General Thunderbolt Ross Both Banner and Hulk have families created in their respective personas Banner is son to Brian an abusive father who killed Banners mother while she tried to protect her son from his fathers delusional attacks and cousin to Jennifer Walters the She-Hulk who serves as his frequent ally 117 Banner had a stillborn child with Betty while the Hulk has two sons with his deceased second wife Caiera Oldstrong Skaar and Hiro-Kala and his DNA was used to create a daughter named Lyra with Thundra the warrior woman 118 The Fantastic Four 12 March 1963 featured the Hulks first battle with the Thing Although many early Hulk stories involve General Thaddeus Thunderbolt Ross trying to capture or destroy the Hulk the main villain is often a radiation-based character like the Gargoyle or the Leader along with other foes such as the Toad Men or Asian warlord General Fang Ross daughter Betty loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk General Ross right-hand man Major Glenn Talbot also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing Hulk and trying to gain Bettys love more honorably Rick Jones serves as the Hulks friend and sidekick in these early tales The Hulks archenemies are the Abomination and the Leader The Abomination is more monstrous and wreaks havoc for fun and pleasure The Leader is a super-genius who has tried plan after plan to take over the worldThe Hulk is often viewed as a reaction to war As well as being a reaction to the Cold War the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the Vietnam War raised and Ang Lee said that the Iraq War influenced his direction 12126127 In the Michael Nyman edited edition of The Guardian Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics reaction to the September 11 attacks Diekmann discussed The Hulks appearance in the 911 tribute comic Heroes claiming that his greater prominence alongside Captain America aided in stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist 128 In Marvel Five Fabulous Decades of the Worlds Greatest Comics Les Daniels addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science He quotes Jack Kirby thus As long as were experimenting with radioactivity theres no telling what may happen or how much our advancements in science may cost us Daniels continues The Hulk became Marvels most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the atomic age 129 In Comic Book Nation Bradford Wright alludes to Hulks counterculture status referring to a 1965 Esquire magazine poll amongst college students which revealed that student radicals ranked Spider-Man and the Hulk alongside the likes of Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons Wright goes on to cite examples of his anti-authority symbol status Two of these are The Ballad of the Hulk by Jerry Jeff Walker and the Rolling Stone cover for September 30 1971 a full color Herb Trimpe piece commissioned for the magazine 71130 The Hulk has been caricatured in such animated television series as The Simpsons 131 Robot Chicken and Family Guy 132 and such comedy TV series as The Young Ones 133 The character is also used as a cultural reference point for someone displaying anger or agitation For example in a 2008 Daily Mirror review of an EastEnders episode a character is described as going into Incredible Hulk mode smashing up his flat 134 The Hulk especially his alter-ego Bruce Banner is also a common reference in rap music The term was represented as an analogue to marijuana in Dr Dres 2001135 while more conventional references are made in Ludacris and Jermaine Dupris popular single Welcome to Atlanta 136 The 2003 Ang Lee directed Hulk film saw discussion of the characters appeal to Asian Americans 137 The Taiwanese-born Ang Lee commented on the subcurrent of repression that underscored the character of The Hulk and how that mirrored his own experience Growing up my artistic leanings were always repressedthere was always pressure to do something useful like being a doctor Jeff Yang writing for the San Francisco Chronicle extended this self-identification to Asian American culture arguing that the passive-aggressive streak runs deep among Asian Americansespecially those who have entered creative careers often against their parents wishes 138 There have been explorations about the real world possibility of Hulks gamma-radiation based origin In The Science of Superheroes Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulks powers explaining the scientific flaws in them Most notably they point out that the level of gamma radiation Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him or if not create significant cancer risks for Banner because hard radiation strips cells of their ability to function They go on to offer up an alternate origin in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with adrenal glands and GFP Charles Q Choi from LiveSciencecom further explains that unlike the Hulk gamma rays are not green existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and 10000 times more powerful than visible light that they can even convert energy into matter  a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations Just as the Incredible Hulk is the strongest one there is as he says himself so too are gamma ray bursts the most powerful explosions known 139
