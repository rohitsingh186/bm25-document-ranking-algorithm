pulp magazine publisher who had started with a Western pulp in 1933 was expanding into the emergingand by then already highly popularnew medium of comic books Launching his new line from his existing companys offices at 330 West 42 nd Street New York City he officially held the titles of editor managing editor and business manager with Abraham Goodman officially listed as publisher 8 Timelys first

create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes 11 Captain America in Captain America Comics 1 March 1941 It too proved a hit with sales of nearly one million 10 Goodman formed Timely Comics Inc beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 19411213 While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these big three some notable heroesmany of which continue to appear in modern-day retcon appearances and flashbacksinclude the Whizzer Miss America the Destroyer the original Vision and the Angel Timely also published one of humor cartoonist Basil Wolvertons best-known features Powerhouse Pepper 1415 as well as a line of childrens funny-animal comics featuring popular characters like Super Rabbit and the duo Ziggy Pig and Silly SealGoodman hired his wifes cousin 16 Stanley Lieber as a general office assistant in 193917 When editor Simon left the company in late 194118 Goodman made Lieberby then writing pseudonymously as Stan Leeinterim editor of the comics line a position Lee kept for decades except for three years during his military service in World War II Lee wrote extensively for Timely contributing to a number of different titlesGoodmans business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of corporations all operating out of the same office and with the same staff 13 One of these shell companies through which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by at least Marvel Mystery Comics 55 May 1944 As well some comics covers such as All Surprise Comics 12 Winter 194647 were labeled A Marvel Magazine many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in 196119 The post-war American comic market saw superheroes falling out of fashion 20 Goodmans comic book line dropped them for the most part and expanded into a wider variety of genres than even Timely had published featuring horror Westerns humor funny animal mens adventure-drama giant monster crime and war comics and later adding jungle books romance titles espionage and even medieval adventure Bible stories and sportsGoodman began using the globe logo of the Atlas News Company the newsstand-distribution company he owned 21 on comics cover-dated November 1951 even though another company Kable News continued to distribute his comics through the August 1952 issues 22 This globe branding united a line put out by the same publisher staff and freelancers through 59 shell companies from Animirth Comics to Zenith Publications 23 Atlas rather than innovate took a proven route of following popular trends in television and moviesWesterns and war dramas prevailing for a time drive-in movie monsters another timeand even other comic books particularly the EC horror line 24 Atlas also published a plethora of childrens and teen humor titles including Dan DeCarlos Homer the Happy Ghost  la Casper the Friendly Ghost and Homer Hooper  la Archie Andrews Atlas unsuccessfully attempted to revive superheroes from late 1953 to mid-1954 with the Human Torch art by Syd Shores and Dick Ayers variously the Sub-Mariner drawn and most stories written by Bill Everett and Captain America writer Stan Lee artist John Romita Sr Atlas did not achieve any breakout hits and according to Stan Lee Atlas survived chiefly because it produced work quickly cheaply and at a passable quality 25 The first modern comic books under the Marvel Comics brand were the science-fiction anthology Journey into Mystery 69 and the teen-humor title Patsy Walker 95 both cover dated June 1961 which each displayed an MC box on its cover 26 Then in the wake of DC Comics success in reviving superheroes in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s particularly with the Flash Green Lantern and other members of the team the Justice League of America Marvel followed suitn 1 In 1961 writer-editor Stan Lee revolutionised the superhero comic by attempting to market a new era of superheroes to older readers like himself for the first time as he saw untapped potential in the genre The introduction of modern Marvels first superhero team in The Fantastic Four 1 Nov 196127 kicked this off establishing the companys reputationSubsequently Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated 28 This applied to The Amazing Spider-Man title in particular which turned out to be their most successful book Its young hero suffered from self-doubt and mundane problems like any other teenager something readers could relate to the superheroLee and freelance artist-writer Jack Kirbys Fantastic Four originated in a Cold War culture that led their creators to revise the superhero conventions of previous eras to better reflect the psychological spirit of their age 29 Eschewing such comic book tropes as secret identities and even costumes at first having a monster as one of the heroes and having its characters bicker and complain in what was later called a superheroes in the real world approach the series represented a change that proved to be a great success 30 Marvel often presented flawed superheroes freaks and misfitsunlike the perfect handsome athletic heroes found in previous traditional comic books Some Marvel heroes looked like villains and monsters such as the Hulk and the Thing This naturalistic approach even extended into topical politicsComics historian Mike Benton also notedIn the world of rival DC Comics Superman comic books communism did not exist Superman rarely crossed national borders or involved himself in political disputes 31 From 1962 to 1965 there were more communists in Marvel Comics than on the subscription list of Pravda Communist agents attack Ant-Man in his laboratory red henchmen jump the Fantastic Four on the moon and Viet Cong guerrillas take potshots at Iron Man 32 All this elements struck a chord with the older readers such as college-aged adults they successfully gained in a way not seen before In 1965 Spider-Man and the Hulk were both featured in Esquire magazines list of 28 college campus heroes alongside John F Kennedy and Bob Dylan 33 In 2009 writer Geoff Boucher reflected that Superman and DC Comics instantly seemed like boring old Pat Boone Marvel felt like The Beatles and the British Invasion It was Kirbys artwork with its tension and psychedelia that made it perfect for the timesor was it Lees bravado and melodrama which was somehow insecure and brash at the same time 34 In addition to Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four Marvel began publishing further superhero titles featuring such heroes and antiheroes as the Hulk Thor Ant-Man Iron Man the X-Men Daredevil the Inhumans Black Panther Doctor Strange Captain Marvel and the Silver Surfer and such memorable antagonists as Doctor Doom Magneto Galactus Loki the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus all existing in a shared reality known as the Marvel Universe with locations that mirror real-life cities such as New York Los Angeles and ChicagoMarvel even lampooned itself and other comics companies in a parody comic Not Brand Echh a play on Marvels dubbing of other companies as Brand Echh  la the then-common phrase Brand X 35 In 1968 while selling 50 million comic books a year company founder Goodman revised the constraining distribution arrangement with Independent News he had reached under duress during the Atlas years allowing him now to release as many titles as demand warranted 21 Late that year he sold Marvel Comics and his other publishing businesses to the Perfect Film and Chemical Corporation which continued to group them as the subsidiary Magazine Management Company with Goodman remaining as publisher 36 In 1969 Goodman finally ended his distribution deal with Independent by signing with Curtis Circulation Company 21 In 1971 the United States Department of Health Education and Welfare approached Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee to do a comic book story about drug abuse Lee agreed and wrote a three-part Spider-Man story portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous However the industrys self-censorship board the Comics Code Authority refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics deeming the context of the story irrelevant Lee with Goodmans approval published the story regardless in The Amazing Spider-Man 9698 MayJuly 1971 without the Comics Code seal The market reacted well to the storyline and the CCA subsequently revised the Code the same year 37 Goodman retired as publisher in 1972 and installed his son Chip as publisher 38 Shortly thereafter Lee succeeded him as publisher and also became Marvels president 38 for a brief time 39 During his time as president he appointed as editor-in-chief Roy Thomas who added Stan Lee Presents to the opening page of each comic book 38 A series of new editors-in-chief oversaw the company during another slow time for the industry Once again Marvel attempted to diversify and with the updating of the Comics Code achieved moderate to strong success with titles themed to horror The Tomb of Dracula martial arts Shang-Chi Master of Kung Fu sword-and-sorcery Conan the Barbarian Red Sonja satire Howard the Duck and science fiction 2001 A Space Odyssey Killraven in Amazing Adventures Star Trek and late in the decade the long-running Star Wars series Some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines under its Curtis Magazines imprint Marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line Marvel pulled ahead of rival DC Comics in 1972 during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux 40 Goodman increased the price and size of Marvels November 1971 cover-dated comics from 15 cents for 36 pages total to 25 cents for 52 pages DC followed suit but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount 41 Goodman now disconnected from Marvel set up a new company called Seaboard Periodicals in 1974 reviving Marvels old Atlas name for a new Atlas Comics line but this lasted only a year and a half 42 In the mid-1970 s a decline of the newsstand distribution network affected Marvel Cult hits such as Howard the Duck fell victim to the distribution problems with some titles reporting low sales when in fact the first specialty comic book stores resold them at a later datecitation needed But by the end of the decade Marvels fortunes were reviving thanks to the rise of direct market distributionselling through those same comics-specialty stores instead of newsstandsMarvel held its own comic book convention Marvelcon 75 in spring 1975 and promised a Marvelcon 76 At the 1975 event Stan Lee used a Fantastic Four panel discussion to announce that Jack Kirby the artist co-creator of most of Marvels signature characters was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for rival DC Comics 43 In October 1976 Marvel which already licensed reprints in different countries including the UK created a superhero specifically for the British market Captain Britain debuted exclusively in the UK and later appeared in American comics 44 In 1978 Jim Shooter became Marvels editor-in-chief Although a controversial personality Shooter cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel including repeatedly missed deadlines During Shooters nine-year tenure as editor-in-chief Chris Claremont and John Byrnes run on the Uncanny X-Men and Frank Millers run on Daredevil became critical and commercial successes 46 Shooter brought Marvel into the rapidly evolving direct market 47 institutionalized creator royalties starting with the Epic Comics imprint for creator-owned material in 1982 introduced company-wide crossover story
