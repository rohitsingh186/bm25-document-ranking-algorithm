Siegel and artist Joe Shuster in 1933 the character was sold to Detective Comics Inc later DC Comics in 193867 Superman first appeared in Action Comics 1 June 1938 and subsequently appeared in various radio serials newspaper strips television programs films and video games With the characters success Superman helped to create the superhero genre and establish its primacy within the American comic book 2 Supermans appearance is distinctive and iconic he usually wears a blue costume red cape and stylized red-and-yellow S shield on his chest 8910 This shield is used in a myriad of media to symbolize the character 11 The origin story of Superman relates that he was born Kal-El on the planet Krypton before being rocketed to Earth as an infant by his scientist father Jor-El moments before Kryptons destruction Discovered and adopted by a Kansas farmer and his wife the child is raised as Clark Kent and imbued with a strong moral compass Very early on he started to display superhuman abilities which upon reaching maturity he resolved to use for the benefit of humanity Superman resides and operates in the fictional American city of Metropolis As Clark Kent Supermans secret identity he is a journalist for the Daily Planet a Metropolis newspaper Supermans primary love interest is Lois Lane and his archenemy is supervillain Lex Luthor 12 Superman has fascinated scholars with cultural theorists commentators and critics alike exploring the characters impact and role in the United States and worldwide The characters ownership has often been the subject of dispute with Siegel and Shuster twice suing for the return of legal ownership Superman has been labeled as the greatest comic book hero of all time by IGN as the editors pointed out that Superman was the blueprint for superheroes as we know them today 13 Like other characters in the DC Universe several alternative Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster then high school students in Cleveland first conceived Superman as a bald telepathic villain bent on world domination 67 The character first appeared in The Reign of the Superman a short story from Science Fiction The Advance Guard of Future Civilization 3 a fanzine published by Siegel in 19337 Siegel re-envisioned the character later that year as a hero bearing no resemblance to his villainous namesake with Shuster visually modeling Superman on Douglas Fairbanks Sr and his bespectacled alter ego Clark Kent on a combination of Harold Lloyd 1415 and Shuster himself with the name Clark Kent derived from movie stars Clark Gable and Kent Taylor 16 Lois Lane was modeled on Joanne Carter who later became Siegels wife 16 Comic strips such as Lil Abner and Dick Tracy influenced its original artworkcitation needed Siegel and Shuster then began a six-year quest to find a publisher Titling it The Superman Siegel and Shuster offered it to Consolidated Book Publishing who had published a 48-page black-and-white comic book entitled Detective Dan Secret Operative No 48 Although the duo received an encouraging letter Consolidated never again published comic books Shuster took this to heart and burned all pages of the story the cover surviving only because Siegel rescued it from the fire Siegel and Shuster each compared this character to Slam Bradley an adventurer the pair had created for Detective Comics 1 March 193717 Siegel believing that Superman would not progress with Shuster contacted artists Tony Strobl Mel Graff and Russell Keaton as potential collaborators on the strip 18 Artwork produced by Keaton based on Siegels treatment shows the concept evolving Superman is now sent back in time as a baby by the last man on Earth where he is found and raised by Sam and Molly Kent 19 However Keaton did not pursue the collaboration and soon Siegel and Shuster were back working together on the character 18 The pair re-envisioned the character who became more of a hero in the mythic tradition inspired by such characters as Samson and Hercules 20 who would right the wrongs of Siegel and Shusters times fighting for social justice and against tyranny It was at this stage the costume was introduced Siegel later recalling that they created a kind of costume and lets give him a big S on his chest and a cape make him as colorful as we can and as distinctive as we can 8 The design was based in part on the costumes worn by characters in outer space settings published in pulp magazines as well as comic strips such as Flash Gordon 21 and also partly suggested by the traditional circus strong-man outfits which comprised a pair of shorts worn over a contrasting bodysuit 822 However the cape has been noted as being markedly different from the Victorian tradition Gary Engle described it as without precedent in popular culture in Superman at Fifty The Persistence of a Legend 23 The circus performers shorts-over-tights outfit was soon established as the basis for many future superhero outfits This third version of the character was given extraordinary abilities although this time of a physical nature as opposed to the mental abilities of the villainous Superman 8 The locale and the heros civilian names were inspired by the movies Shuster said in 1983 Jerry created all the names We were great movie fans and were inspired a lot by the actors and actresses we saw As for Clark Kent he combined the names of Clark Gable and Kent Taylor And Metropolis the city in which Superman operated came from the Fritz Lang film Metropolis which we both loved 24 Although they were by now selling material to comic-book publishers notably Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholsons National Allied Publishing the pair attempted to sell their feature as a comic strip They offered it both to Max Gaines who passed and to United Feature Syndicate which expressed interest initially but rejected the strip in a letter dated February 18 1937 However in what historian Les Daniels describes as an incredibly convoluted turn of events Gaines ended up selling the concept as the lead feature in Wheeler-Nicholsons new publication Action Comics Vin Sullivan that comics editor wrote to Siegel and Shuster requesting that their comic-strip samples be reformatted for the comic-book page requesting eight panels a page However Siegel and Shuster ignored this utilizing their own experience and ideas to create page layouts with Siegel also identifying the image used for the cover of Action Comics 1 June 1938 Supermans first appearance 25 Comics historians Gerard Jones and Brad Meltzer believe Siegel may have been inspired to create Superman because of the death of his father Mitchell Siegel an immigrant who owned a clothing store on Clevelands near east side He died during a robbery attempt in 1932 a year before Superman was created Although Siegel never mentioned the death of his father in interviews It had to have an effect argues Jones Theres a connection there the loss of a dad as a source for Superman Meltzer states Your father dies in a robbery and you invent a bulletproof man who becomes the worlds greatest hero 26 An influence on early Superman stories is the context of the Great Depression The left-leaning perspective of creators Shuster and Siegel is reflected in early storylines Superman took on the role of social activist fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run-down tenements 38 Comics scholar Roger Sabin sees this as a reflection of the liberal idealism of Franklin Roosevelts New Deal with Shuster and Siegel initially portraying Superman as champion to a variety of social causes 39 In later Superman radio programs the character continued to take on such issues tackling a version of the Ku Klux Klan in a 1946 broadcast as well as combating anti-semitism and veteran discrimination 404142 Siegel and Shusters status as children of Jewish immigrants is also thought to have influenced their work Timothy Aaron Pevey has argued that they crafted an immigrant figure whose desire was to fit into American culture as an American something Pevey believes taps into an important aspect of the American identity 43 Siegel himself noted the influence of mythic heroes in the traditions of many cultures including Hercules and Samson 8 Scott Bukatman sees the character to be a worthy successor to Lindberg  and also  like Babe Ruth and also representative of the United States dedication to progress and the new through his invulnerable body  on which history cannot be inscribed 44 Because Siegel and Shuster were fans of pulp science fiction 7 it is widely assumed that the 1930 Philip Wylie novel Gladiator featuring a protagonist Hugo Danner with similar powers was an inspiration for Superman 45 though no confirmation exists for this supposition 46 Comics creator and historian Jim Steranko believes that the pulp hero Doc Savage is another likely source of inspiration noting similarities between Shusters initial art and contemporary advertisements for Doc Savage Initially Superman was a variation of pulp heavyweight Doc Savage 47 Steranko argued that the pulps played a major part in shaping the initial concept Siegels Superman concept embodied and amalgamated three separate and distinct themes the visitor from another planet the superhuman being and the dual identity He composed the Superman charisma by exploiting all three elements and all three contributed equally to the eventual success of the strip His inspiration of course came from the science fiction pulps 47 identifying as another possible inspiration John W Campbells Aarn Munro stories about a descendant of earthmen raised on the planet Jupiter who because of the planets dense gravity is a mental and physical superman on Earth 47 Because Siegel and Shuster were both Jewish some religious commentators and pop-culture scholars such as Rabbi Simcha Weinstein and British novelist Howard Jacobson suggest that Supermans creation was partly influenced by Moses 4849 and other Jewish elements More recently this interpretation has been endorsed by biographer Larry Tye 50 For example Supermans Kryptonian name Kal-El resembles the Hebrew words - which can be taken to mean voice of God 51 The suffix el meaning of God is also found in the name of angels eg Gabriel Ariel who are flying humanoid agents of good with superhuman powers Tye suggests that this Voice of God is an allusion to Moses role as a prophet 50 Moreover Kal-Els parents send him away in a vessel delivering him to new adoptive parents in an alien culture in order to save him from impending doom just as Moses parents do 50 The narratives of Kryptons birth and death borrowed the language of Genesis 50 On the other hand Superman has been seen by others as being an analogy for Jesus being a savior of humanity 3949505253 Furthermore the surname Kent in early 20 th century real life was a common Americanization of Cohen and Clark Kents wimpy bumbling persona strongly resembled the classic Yiddish schlemielWhile the term bermensch was initially coined by Friedrich Nietzsche and translated by Shaw as Superman it is unclear how influential Nietzsche and his ideals were to Siegel and Shuster 49 Les Daniels has speculated that Siegel picked up the term from other science fiction writers who had casually employed it further noting that his concept is remembered by hundreds of millions who may barely know who Nietzsche is 8 Others argue that Siegel and Shuster could not have been unaware of an idea that would dominate Hitlers National Socialism The concept was certainly well discussed 54 Yet Jacobson and others point out that in many ways Superman and the bermensch are polar opposites 48 Nietzsche envisioned the bermensch as a man who had transcended the limitations of society religion and conventional morality while still being fundamentally human Superman although an alien gifted with incredible powers chooses to honor human moral codes and social mores Nietzsche envisioned the perfect man as being beyond moral codes Siegel and Shuster envisioned the perfect man as holding himself to a higher standard of adherence to them 55 Siegel and Shuster have themselves discussed a number of influences that impacted upon the character Both were avid readers and their mutual love of science fiction helped to drive their friendship Siegel cited John Carter stories as an influence Carter was able to leap great distances because the planet Mars was smaller than the planet Earth and he had great strength I visualized the planet Krypton as a huge planet much larger than Earth 24 The pair were also avid collectors of comic strips in their youth cutting them from the newspaper with Winsor McCays Little Nemo firing their imagination with its sense of fantasy 56 Shuster has remarked on the artists which played an important part in the development of his own style whilst also noting a larger influence Alex Raymond and Burne Hogarth were my idols  also Milt Caniff Hal Foster and Roy Crane But the movies were the greatest influence on our imagination especially the films of Douglas Fairbanks 57 Fairbanks role as Robin Hood in 1922 was certainly an inspiration since Shuster admitted to basing Supermans stance upon scenes from the movie 58 The movies also influenced the storytelling and page layouts 59 while the city of Metropolis was named in honor of the Fritz Lang motion picture of the same title 24 Given the serial nature of comic publishing and the length of the characters existence Superman has evolved as a character over the years 82 The details of Supermans origin relationships and abilities changed significantly during the characters publication from what is considered the Golden Age of Comic Books through the Modern Age Supermans powers and villains were developed through the 1940 s with Superman developing the ability to fly and costumed villains introduced in 194183 The character was shown as learning of the existence of Krypton in 1949 The concept itself had originally been established to the reader in 1939 in the Superman comic strip 84 The 1960 s saw the introduction of a second Superman DC had established a multiverse within the fictional universe its characters shared This allowed characters published in the 1940 s to exist alongside updated counterparts published in the 1960 s This was explained to the reader through the notion that the two groups of characters inhabited parallel Earths The second Superman was introduced to explain to the reader Supermans membership in both the 1940 s superhero team the Justice Society of America and the 1960 s superhero team the Justice League of America 85 The 1980 s saw radical revisions of the character DC decided to remove the multiverse in a bid to simplify its comics line This led to the rewriting of the back story of the characters DC published Superman included John Byrne rewrote Superman removing many established conventions and characters from continuity including Superboy and Supergirl Byrne also re-established Supermans adoptive parents The Kents as characters 86 In the previous continuity the characters had been written as having died early in Supermans life about the time of Clark Kents graduation from high schoolIn 1992 Superman was killed by the villain Doomsday 87 although the character was soon resurrected the following year 88 Superman also marries Lois Lane in 1996 His origin is again revisited in 200489 In 2006 Superman is stripped of his powers 90 although these are restored within a fictional year 91 After a confrontation with Brainiac that results in his fathers death Superman discovers the lost city of Kandor which contains 10000 Kryptonians Their stay on Earth causes trouble and the Kryptonians create their own planet New Krypton Eventually New Krypton wages war against Earth The two sides sustain major casualties and most of the Kryptonians are killed Superman then starts a journey to reconnect with his adopted home world 92 In 2011 DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books including the Superman franchise in order to make the characters more modern and accessible In the new continuity Clark is no longer married to Lois and his parents died when he was in high school Superman wears a ceremonial battle armor which pays tribute to his Kryptonian heritage The armor is similar to his classic outfit with the difference of lacking the traditional red briefs In Superman Vol 3 38 February 2015 the armor was destroyed and he received a new cloth costume with a few cosmetic differences 93 As of March 2015 it was announced Superman would be using a different outfit consisting on a simple blue T-shirt with the S symbol and regular jeans and tennis shoes for Action Comics vol 2 41 June 2015 as part of a storyline in which Superman is significantly depowered and his secret identity exposed to the whole world forcing him to drastically change his approach to heroism and struggle with weakness for the first time 94 Age and birthdaySupermans age has varied through his history in comics His age was originally left undefined with real time references to specific years sometimes given to past events in Golden Age and early Silver Age comics In comics published between the early 1970 s and early 1990 s his age was usually cited as 29 years old 95 However during The Death of Superman storyline Clarks age was given as 34 years old in a fictional promotional newspaper published while 1994 s Zero Hour timeline established his age as 35 In the Golden Age 1950 s Action Comics 149 gives October as Supermans birthdate In Silver Age and Bronze Age stories Supermans birthday is described as being on February 29 as shown in Superman Annual 11 in 1985 Clark Kent meanwhile would celebrate his birthday on June 18 the date the Kents first found Clark June 18 is also the birthdate of Superman voice actor Bud Collyer 96 Post-Crisis stories also reference February 29 as Clark Kents birthday as shown in Action Comics 655 July 1990 However 2009 s Superman Secret Origin depicts Clark celebrating his birthday on December 197 As an influential archetype of the superhero genre Superman possesses extraordinary powers with the character traditionally described as Faster than a speeding bullet More powerful than a locomotive Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound  Its Superman 114 a phrase coined by Jay Morton and first used in the Superman radio serials and Max Fleischer animated shorts of the 1940 s 115 as well as the TV series of the 1950 s For most of his existence Supermans famous arsenal of powers has included flight super-strength invulnerability to non-magical attacks super-speed vision powers including x-ray heat-emitting telescopic infra-red and microscopic vision super-hearing super-intelligence and super-breath which enables him to blow out air at freezing temperatures as well as exert the propulsive force of high-speed winds 116 As originally conceived and presented in his early stories Supermans powers were relatively limited consisting of superhuman strength that allowed him to lift a car over his head run at amazing speeds and leap one-eighth of a mile as well as an incredibly dense body structure that could be pierced by nothing less than an exploding artillery shell 116 Siegel and Shuster compared his strength and leaping abilities to an ant and a grasshopper 117 When making the Superman cartoons in the early 1940 s the Fleischer Brothers found it difficult to keep animating him leaping and requested to DC to change his ability to flying this was an especially convenient concept for short films which would have otherwise had to waste precious running time moving earthbound Clark Kent from place to place 118 Writers gradually increased his powers to larger extents during the Silver Age in which Superman could fly to other worlds and galaxies and even across universes with relative ease 116 He would often fly across the solar system to stop meteors from hitting the Earth or sometimes just to clear his head Writers found it increasingly difficult to write Superman stories in which the character was believably challenged 119 so DC made a series of attempts to rein the character in The most significant attempt John Byrnes 1986 rewrite established several hard limits on his abilities He barely survives a nuclear blast and his space flights are limited by how long he can hold his breath 120 Supermans power levels have again increased since then with Superman currently possessing enough strength to hurl mountains withstand nuclear blasts with ease fly into the sun unharmed and survive in the vacuum of outer space without oxygenThe source of Supermans powers has changed subtly over the course of his history It was originally stated that Supermans abilities derived from his Kryptonian heritage which made him eons more evolved than humans 84 This was soon amended with the source for the powers now based upon the establishment of Kryptons gravity as having been stronger than that of the Earth This situation mirrors that of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter As Supermans powers increased the implication that all Kryptonians had possessed the same abilities became problematic for writers making it doubtful that a race of such beings could have been wiped out by something as trifling as an exploding planet In part to counter this the Superman writers established that Kryptonians whose native star Rao had been red possessed superpowers only under the light of a yellow sun 121 Superman is most vulnerable to green Kryptonite mineral debris from Krypton transformed into radioactive material by the forces that destroyed the planet Exposure to green Kryptonite radiation nullifies Supermans powers and immobilizes him with pain and nausea prolonged exposure will eventually kill him The only substance on Earth that can protect him from Kryptonite is lead which blocks the radiation Lead is also the only known substance that Superman cannot see through with his x-ray vision Kryptonite was first introduced to the public in 1943 as a plot device to allow the radio serial voice actor Bud Collyer to take some time off 82 Although green Kryptonite is the most commonly seen form writers have introduced other forms over the years such as red gold blue white and black each with its own effect 122
