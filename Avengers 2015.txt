of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination while Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction However Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a

body but Ultron captures RomanoffThe Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads JARVIS  who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet  into the synthetic body Thor returns to help activate the body explaining that the gem on its brow  one of the six Infinity Stones the most powerful objects in existence  was part of his vision This Vision and the

manipulated recent events As Stark and Barton also leave Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers Rhodes the Vision Sam Wilson and WandaIn a mid-credits scene Thanos dissatisfied by the failures of his pawns dons a gauntlet 3 and vows to personally retrieve the Infinity StonesRobert Downey Jr as Tony Stark  Iron ManThe benefactor of the Avengers 345 who is a self-described genius billionaire playboy and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own invention 6 On how his character evolves after the events of Iron Man 3 Downey said I think he realizes that tweaking and making all the suits in the worldwhich is what he has been doingstill didnt work for that thing of his tour of duty that left him a little PTSD So his focus is more on how can we make it so that theres no problem to begin with That you know theres a bouncer at our planets rope Thats the big idea 7 Chris Hemsworth as ThorAn Avenger and the crown prince of Asgard based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name 8 Regarding Thors place in the film Hemsworth stated that Thor has remained on Earth since Thor The Dark World and has begun to feel at home here so he considers the threat from Ultron to be a personal attack 9 Hemsworth stated that he had to work harder to bring new elements to the character to avoid repeating himself saying It gave us room to kind of make him a little more grounded and human and have him in some civilian clothes and mixing it up at a party 10 Hemsworth noted that this is the first MCU film in which he did not work closely with Tom Hiddleston so Thors motivation in this film is completely different as it was previously driven by his relationship with Loki 5 Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner  HulkAn Avenger and a genius scientist who because of exposure to gamma radiation transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated 11 Ruffalo worked with motion capture performer Andy Serkis The Imaginarium Studios in preparation for the role 12 Ruffalo stated that the role grew from the previous film and is a bit more complex 13 Ruffalo explained that a confrontation is brewing between Banner and the Hulk saying Theres a very cool thing happening Hulk is as afraid of Banner as Banner is afraid of Hulk and they have got to come to peace somehow with each other 14 While filming in London Ruffalo said that Whedon still had not given him any of the Hulks lines 15 Whedon later explained that he writes the Hulks dialogue spontaneously saying What makes the Hulk so hard to write is that youre pretending hes a werewolf when hes a superhero You want it vice versa So the question is how has he progressed How can we bring changes on what the Hulk does And thats not just in the screenplay thats moment to moment 16 Chris Evans as Steve Rogers  Captain AmericaThe leader of the Avengers 35 and a World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world 1718 Evans stated that since the fall of SHIELD in Captain America The Winter Soldier Rogers has been left to depend on his Avenger teammates without the structure of military life and is now looking to understand where he belongs not just as a soldier as Captain America but as Steve Rogers as a person 10 Evans said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for Captain America The Winter Soldier by working out up to an hour a day 19 Regarding Captain Americas fighting style Evans felt he did not want to take a step back from the skills shown in The Winter Soldier making sure Rogers fight style advanced showing a consistent display of strength and having Rogers utilizing his environment 20 Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff  Black WidowAn Avenger who formerly worked for SHIELD as a highly trained spy 21 Producer Kevin Feige stated that more of the characters backstory is explored in the film 22 Johansson elaborated In Avengers 2 we go back we definitely learn more about Widows backstory and we get to find out how she became the person you see All of these characters have deep dark pasts and I think that the past catches up to some of us a little bit 23 On where the film picks up Widows story Johansson felt it was a continuation of what was seen for her character in The Winter Soldier with the fact that Widow never made an active choice Shes a product of other peoples imposition Thats going to catch up with her Thats bound to have a huge effect Theres got to be a result of that realization Youll see her actively making some choices in her life for better or worse 24 A mixture of close-ups concealing costumes stunt doubles and visual effects were used to help hide Johanssons pregnancy during filming 25 Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton  HawkeyeAn Avenger and master archer who previously worked as an agent for SHIELD 26 Whedon said that Hawkeye interacts more with the other characters in the film as opposed to the first film where the character had been possessed pretty early by a bad guy and had to walk around all scowly 27 As the character did not appear in any other of Marvels Phase Two films Whedon stated Age of Ultron sheds light on to what the character was doing since the end of The Avengers 16 Renner described the character as kind of a loner and a team player only cause he sort of has to be Hes not really a company man Captain America can be that guy In Age of Ultron youll understand why Hawkeye thinks the way he thinks 20 Don Cheadle as James Rhodey Rhodes  War Machine An officer in the US Air Force and Tony Starks close personal friend who operates the War Machine armor 2829 Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Pietro Maximoff  QuicksilverThe twin brother of the Scarlet Witch who can move at superhuman speed 30 Taylor-Johnson felt Pietro was defined by the fact that he and his sister were abandoned by their family and they both had to grow up in Eastern Europe defending and looking out for themselves and each other that they both look to the other for guidance Taylor-Johnson also said that Quicksilver was very overprotective of Scarlet Witch and has real anger frustration which results in him being easily bored because of a short attention span 31 Feige stated exploring Quicksilvers relationship with his sister and his backstory growing up in Eastern Europe would help differentiate the character from Evan Peters version in X-Men Days of Future Past 201432 Taylor-Johnson stated that the running style for Quicksilver went through multiple iterations saying The running style we tested early on was just very one-dimensional and boring to look at but if you try to do free running like parkour then thats very much Captain Americas style You have to find your own place in the stunt world 5 Much of Taylor-Johnsons scenes were filmed outdoors to give life to his running as opposed to running indoors in front of a green screen 33 Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff  Scarlet WitchThe twin sister of Quicksilver who can harness magic and engage in hypnosis and telekinesis 3034 Olsen felt Wanda was overly stimulated rather than mentally insane because she has such a vast amount of knowledge that shes unable to learn how to control it No one taught her how to control it properly she can connect to this world and parallel worlds at the same time and parallel times 34 Describing her characters mind control powers Olsen said that the character is able to do more than manipulating someones mind with Scarlet Witch able to feel and see what they feel and see by projecting visions that they have never seen Olsen expanded saying What I love about her is that in so many superhero films emotions are kind of negated a bit but for her everything that someone else could feellike their weakest momentsshe physically goes through that same experience with them which is pretty cool 35 Olsen drew on her relationship with her older brother and her sisters to prepare for the role 34 as well as looking to the comics for inspiration 5 Olsen revealed that Whedon was inspired by dancers as a way to visually represent how the character moves As such Olsen mostly trained with a dancer in lieu of traditional stunt training 36 Olsen is signed for this film and another 33 Paul Bettany as JARVIS and VisionBettany who voiced JARVIS Starks AI companion in previous films was cast again as the Vision 3738 an android created by Ultron 39 Bettany stated that he was surprised when Whedon asked him if he wanted to be the Vision because once an actor has been cast as a particular character in the MCU they usually are not cast as another 40 On what intrigued him about the Vision Bettany said The thing that appealed to me is that this sort of nascent creature being born being both omnipotent and totally naive the sort of danger of that and complex nature of a thing being born that is that powerful and that created in a second and the choices he makes morally are really complex and interesting Theyve really managed to maintain all of that 40 Bettany also stated that the Vision feels paternal and protective to a number of people in the film particularly Scarlet Witch and has the ability to change his density Bettany did wire work for the part 40 Whedon stated he wanted to include the Vision in a second Avengers film before he signed onto the first film 16 Bettanys make-up which consisted of a mix of face paint and prosthetics took two-hours to apply with make-up artists Jeremy Woodhead and Nik Williams citing the correct hue of the Visions skin as the hardest thing to figure out 41 Cobie Smulders as Maria HillA former high-ranking SHIELD agent who now works for Stark 424344 Describing Hills situation in the film Smulders said that after The Winter Soldier Hill does not really know whos a good guy and whos a bad guy and shes trying to figure out that throughout this film She added Shes not getting any sleep Shes doing all the work She doesnt have the kind of manpower that she had in SHIELD 45 instead working for Tony Stark at the Avengers headquarters trying to keep everything running as smoothly as possible its an entirely different vibe for her 46 Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson  FalconA former pararescueman trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack and a friend of Steve Rogers 47 Discussing the relationship between Wilson and Rogers Mackie said that the two characters have a mutual soldier respect which is explored in the film and in Captain America Civil War 48 Feige said that it was decided to reshoot the final scene of the film to incorporate the new Falcon suit designed for Ant-Man which released after Age of Ultron as Falcon was originally shot in his original suit from The Winter Soldier 49 Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter A retired officer with the Strategic Scientific Reserve and a co-founder of SHIELD who is a former love interest of Steve Rogers 50 Idris Elba as Heimdall The all-seeing all-hearing Asgardian sentry of the Bifrst Bridge based on the mythological deity of the same name 51 Stellan Skarsgrd as Erik Selvig An astrophysicist and a friend of Thor 52 James Spader as UltronAn artificial intelligence repurposed by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner for a pilot peace program that is overwhelmed with a god complex and now desires to pacify the Earth by eradicating humanity 395354555657 Director Joss Whedon stated that Spader was his first and only choice for the role because of his hypnotic voice that can be eerily calm and compelling while also being very human and humorous 58 Feige clarified that Spaders face and body were motion captured to create a whole performance We did not hire James Spader to do a robot voice 59 Extensive scans were taken of Spaders head and body in preparation for the role 60 About the character Whedon said Hes always trying to destroy the Avengers goddamn it hes got a bee in his bonnet Hes not a happy guy which means hes an interesting guy Hes got pain And the way that manifests is not going to be standard robot stuff 61 Whedon added that Ultron is not a creature of logiches a robot whos genuinely disturbed Were finding out what makes him menacing and at the same time endearing and funny and strange and unexpected and everything a robot never is 62 Whedon compared Ultron to Frankensteins monster saying Its our new Frankenstein myth  We create something in our own image and the thing turns on us It has that pain of Well why was I made I want to kill Daddy 63 Spader called the character self-absorbed and added I think he sees the Avengers as being part of a problem a more comprehensive problem in the world He sees the world from a very strange biblical point of view because hes brand new hes very young Hes immature and yet has knowledge of comprehensive broad history and precedent and he has created in a very short period of time a rather skewed worldview 64 Samuel L Jackson as Nick FuryThe former director of SHIELD who originally recruited the Avengers and continues to be a mentor and leader for the team 5665 Jackson described the role as a cameo saying Im just kind of passing by there  Because its another one of those people who have powers fighting people who have powers Thats why I didnt get to New York in The Avengers Theres not a lot I could do except shoot a gun 66 Thomas Kretschmann and Henry Goodman reprise their roles as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker and Dr List 6768 Hydra leaders who specialize in human experimentation advanced robotics and artificial intelligence from Captain America The Winter Soldier 56 Linda Cardellini portrays Laura Barton Hawkeyes wife 6970 Claudia Kim portrays Helen Cho a world-renowned geneticist who helps the Avengers from her office in Seoul 5671 and Andy Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue a black-market arms dealer smuggler and gangster who is a former acquaintance from Starks weapons-dealing days 295672 Julie Delpy appears as Madame B who mentored Black Widow into becoming an assassin 73 Kerry Condon voices the artificial intelligence FRIDAY a replacement for JARVIS 74 Josh Brolin makes an uncredited appearance during the mid-credits scene as Thanos 75 Avengers co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in the film as a military veteran who attends the Avengers victory party 76 Tom Hiddleston was cast as Loki but his scenes did not make the theatrical cut of the film 77 In October 2011 Kevin Feige president of Marvel Studios said the studio was beginning to look at their Phase Two films which would start with Iron Man 3 and would culminate in a second Avengers film 79 In March 2012 Joss Whedon director of the first film stated that he would want a sequel to be smaller More personal More painful By being the next thing that should happen to these characters and not just a rehash of what seemed to work the first time By having a theme that is completely fresh and organic to itself 80 Despite the production of the film becoming increasingly wider in scope Feige maintained that this was not their intention always looking to see where the team wanted to take the characters over how to make it bigger than The Avengers 81 At the premiere of The Avengers Feige said the studio had an option for Whedon to return as director 82 In May 2012 after the successful release of the first film Disney CEO Bob Iger announced a sequel was in development 83 Most of the films cast members were under contract to potentially appear in the sequel however Robert Downey Jr was not as his four picture deal with Marvel expired after Iron Man 384 At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International Whedon said he was undecided about directing 85 However in August 2012 Iger announced that Whedon would return to write and direct the sequel and develop the Marvel television series Agents of SHIELD for ABC 86 Later in the month Disney set a May 1 2015 release date 87 When asked about his decision to return Whedon said Avengers 2 it wasnt a tough decision For a long time I thought Well its just not going to happen Then when I actually started to consider it it became so clear that I desperately wanted to say more about these characters it wouldve been an easy no and it was a spectacularly easy yes There was no wrestling 88 Whedon said that they intended for the films production to not be as rushed as the first one 89 In December 2012 Whedon stated that he had completed an outline for the film 90 In February at the 2013 Jameson Dublin International Film Festival Whedon said that death would play a theme in the sequel 91 and in March he said that he looked to The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather Part II as inspirations 92 Feige revealed that Captain Marvel who is scheduled to appear in her own MCU film in 2018 appeared in an early draft of the screenplay but was removed since the character had not yet been cast saying It didnt feel like the time We didnt want to introduce her fully formed flying in a costume before you knew who she was or how she came to be 93 Whedon went so far as to shoot visual effects plates for Captain Marvel to fly into Avengers Tower at the end of the film those shots were reused however for Scarlet Witch instead 94 By April 2013 filming was scheduled to begin in early 2014 at Shepperton Studios in England 95 At the Hollywood premiere of Iron Man 3 Whedon said that he had completed a draft of the script started the storyboard process and met with actors Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a brothersister act from the comic books 96 later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch 9798 Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film saying their powers are very visually interesting One of the problems I had on the first one was everybody basically had punchy powers Quicksilvers got super speed Scarlet Witch can weave spells and a little telekinesis get inside your head Theres good stuff that they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh 99 though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that 62 Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict They dont like America and they dont like the Avengers The Avengers are like a world power and not everybodys on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights even in the name of justice So you need that dissenting voice and you need to understand it and sympathize with it 33 Because Marvel Studios shares the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20 th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Foxs X-Men films Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants 33 Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers explaining it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers headseither their past or their impressions of whats going on or their fears or all of the above 33 By May Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film 100 A month later Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel as well as a third Avengers film 6 By April 2013 filming was scheduled to begin in early 2014 at Shepperton Studios in England 95 At the Hollywood premiere of Iron Man 3 Whedon said that he had completed a draft of the script started the storyboard process and met with actors Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a brothersister act from the comic books 96

entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film 100 A month later Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel as well as a third Avengers film 6 At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International Whedon announced the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron 101 Despite the subtitle the film is not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron Feige explained that they simply just liked the title Age of Ultron but the plot was taken from decades of Avengers story arcs 102 Whedon added that Ultrons origin would differ from his comics roots and that Hank Pym would not be involved with Ultrons creation Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in Ant-Man which was already in development He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team it would not make sense to bring in a third scientist 103 Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultrons involvement 104105 The title of the film came as a surprise to many fans who were expecting Thanos the mastermind behind the events of the first film to be the main villain in the sequel with Whedon saying Thanos was never meant to be the next villain Hes always been the overlord of villainy and darkness 106 Commenting on finding the right balance between technology- and fantasy-based heroes in Avengers Age of Ultron Feige said Iron Man is a very technological hero his movies are always technologically based The first Thor was all about introducing Asgard and Thor in that more fantastical realm into the more reality-based MCU As we go into Ultron clearly he does come out of technology but were using all of our tools at our disposal that weve established so far as part of the MCU to build the storyline of Age of Ultron 107 Casting continued into August 2013 with the announcement that James Spader would play Ultron 53 In November Marvel confirmed that Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson would play the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver respectively 30 Taylor-Johnson had been in negotiations since as early as June 108109110 while Olsens potential involvement was first reported in August 111112 By the end of the year Mark Ruffalo 11 Chris Evans 17 Samuel L Jackson 65 Chris Hemsworth 8 Scarlett Johansson 21 Jeremy Renner 26 and Cobie Smulders 42 were confirmed to be returning to their roles from the first film and Don Cheadle who portrayed James Rhodes in the Iron Man films had committed to a part in the film 28 In the early months of 2014 Thomas Kretschmann was cast as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker 67 Claudia Kim was cast in an unspecified role 113 and Paul Bettany who voiced JARVIS in previous MCU films was cast as the Vision 38 Whedon said juggling all the characters in the film was a nightmare explaining Theyre very disparate characters The joy of the Avengers is they really dont belong in the same room Its not like the X-Men who are all tortured by the same thing and have similar costumes These guys are just all over the place And so its tough Honestly this is as tough as anything Ive ever done 114 On January 24 2014 the Forte di Bard Association announced that filming would take place at Fort Bard in the Aosta Valley region of Italy in March 2014 as well as other locations in Aosta Valley including Aosta Bard Donnas Pont-Saint-Martin and Verrs 115 The next month the Gauteng Film Commission announced that action

Korea Feige cited the nations cutting-edge technology beautiful landscapes and spectacular architecture as ideal for the film 117 Gyeonggi Province and its capital Seoul were selected as filming locations with South Koreas Ministry of Culture Sports and Tourism reimbursing up to 30 of the studios expenditures as part of a state-funded incentive program 113 Filming began on Tuesday February 11

in the Central Business District of Johannesburg for a period of two weeks 119120 By mid-March principal photography had begun at Shepperton Studios near London and was scheduled to film there for at least four months 121122 Filming at Shepperton as well as other locations in England allowed Whedon to get a number of different looks and textures and moods to give the film a different palette and fresh aesthetic from its predecessor 62 Production designer Charles Wood built an enormous new Avengers Tower set one of the largest sets ever built for a Marvel film The set featured multiple connected environments and levels 123 On March 22 production moved to Fort Bard Italy and continued in the Aosta Valley region through March 28 The region doubled as the fictional Eastern European nation of Sokovia 33 with crews replacing local storefronts with Cyrillic script 124 Filming in South Korea began on March 30 on the Mapo Bridge 125 and continued through April 14 at various locations in Seoul 126 While in Seoul the production was able to attach cameras to drones and race cars to get unique camera angles and footage 123 An artificial island on the Han River known as the Saebit Dungdungseom served as the headquarters of an IT institute featured in the film 127 Scenes involving Ultrons attack on parts of the city were shot in the Gangnam District 126 On April 8 shooting began in the Hawley Woods in Hampshire England 128 In mid-April Hayley Atwell who played Peggy Carter in previous MCU films was on set at the Rivoli Ballroom in London to film a 1940 s flashback sequence 50 In mid-June scenes were shot at the University of East Anglia in Norwich and at Dover Castle in Kent with Dover Castle used for interior shots of Struckers Hydra base in Sokovia 129130131 In July filming took place at a training facility for Londons Metropolitan Police Service which doubled as a city in Sokovia 1033 Additional filming took place in Chittagong Bangladesh including the Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard 132133 and in New York 134135 On August 6 Whedon announced on social media that he had completed principal photography on Avengers Age of Ultron 136 Cinematographer Ben Davis who also worked with Marvel on Guardians of the Galaxy shot the film with a main unit of three Arri Alexa cameras Davis said Although the Alexa was Marvels preferred camera we werent locked into that choice from the start What wasnt negotiable was the fact that we were shooting digital thats how Marvel shoots all of its films Davis also used Blackmagic Designs Pocket Cinema Cameras to meet the needs of the second unit kit explaining The second unit typically needs a fleet of smaller cameras that are less expensive and are rugged enough to handle the various trials by fire as it were that we throw at them 137 About the camera system Whedon stated that this film was shot very differently from the first one using lots of long lenses and that he aimed to shoot the film almost like a documentary 114 To create the scenes depicting how Quicksilver views the world scenes were shot with an ultra-high-speed camera and later combined with shots of Taylor-Johnson moving through the same scene at normal speed 33 In June 2014 the IMAX Corporation announced that the IMAX release of the film would be converted to IMAX 3 D 139 Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsgrd 52 Anthony Mackie 47 Idris Elba and Tom Hiddleston who all reprise their roles from previous MCU films 51 However Hiddlestons scenes did not make the theatrical cut of the film with Whedon saying what was shot didnt play and he did not want the film to feel overstuffed 77 According to Hiddleston In test screenings audiences had overemphasized Lokis role so they thought that because I was in it I was controlling Ultron and it was actually imbalancing peoples expectations 140 Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witchs power 33 In December 2014 Kims role was revealed as Dr Helen Cho 71141 Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios 142 In February 2015 Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film 2956 In early April 2015 Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed to be part of the films cast 6973 At the same time Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene which had become customary for MCU films Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the Shawarma scene in The Avengers explaining It didnt seem to lend itself in the same way and we wanted to be true to what felt right The first rule of making a sequel is take the best moments and do something else Dont do the Indiana Jones gun trick again differently Just go somewhere else Dont try to hit the same highs because people will sense it However Feige clarified There will be a tag shortly after the credits start But theres not a post-post-credit scene 69 In May 2015 Whedon revealed he was in conflict with Marvel executives and the films editors about certain scenes in the film The executives were not thrilled with the scenes at Hawkeyes farm or the dream sequences the Avengers experience because of Scarlet Witch Also Whedon had originally shot a much longer scene with Thor and Selvig in the cave compromising with including a reduced amount of the total footage shot as test audiences did not respond to it 143 In

technology is advancing with the face capture and the motion capture can now being put together allowing you to get a lot more latitude as a performer youre no longer constricted by the attributes that you have as a person your age or weight or size None of that matters anymore And so theres this whole exciting place to go that is kind of unknown 15 Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said that the visual effects team considered depicting the Hulk when manipulated by Wanda Maximoff as being grey skinned with red eyes but eventually decided against it as they did not want to confuse audiences who might associate it with Joe Fixit the grey Hulk from the comics 151 Method Studios created the interior of the new Avengers training facility by digitally designing the training facility extracting the characters from the original set and placing them into the new CG environment Method also contributed to Iron Mans new Mark 45 suit and played a key role in creating

filled with unique imagery and animations that matched the character using them 148 Perception worked on the main-on-end and main titles for the film Before settling on the marble monument depiction for the main-on-end titles Perception created three other versions which were based on Ultrons hive mind ability from the film renderings of power and pure energy inspired by classic comic panels and classic moments for each character The final design was inspired by war monuments such as the Iwo Jima memorial For the main titles Marvel wanted the typeface to be a direct continuation of the first film Perception made the typeface a marble texture to mimic the main-on-end titles and changed the titles rotation away from the camera instead of towards the camera in The Avengers before Age of

182 and within a few hours Marvel officially released the trailer on YouTube 183 Entertainment Weekly and The Hollywood Reporter noted the effective use of the song Ive Got No Strings from Pinocchio 1940 in the trailer 178179 Scott Mendelson of Forbes felt the trailer was such a textbook dark sequel trailer that it borders on parody but said its a pretty spectacular piece of marketing one that elevates itself both by the music choices and by James Spaders vocals as the title villain 180 The trailer received 343 million global views in 24 hours 262 million from Marvels YouTube channel which broke the previous record held by Iron Man 3 with 2314 million views In comparison the original Avengers teaser received 204 million views in 24 hours after its debut 184185 In response Marvel agreed

but wished it did not reveal as many story elements as it did However he added the marketing thus far for the film has been far superior to much of what sold The Avengers three years ago both in terms of the specific footage and the artistic choices being made Im sold and I imagine most of the general moviegoers are already onboard too 196 On February 3 2014 Marvel stealth released a one-shot tie-in comic Avengers Age of Ultron PreludeThis Scepterd Isle Written by Will Corona Pilgrim and illustrated by Wellinton Alves it reveals how Strucker came into possession of Lokis scepter and the origin of the Maximoff twins abilities 197 At the end of the month the films official poster was revealed Graeme McMillian of The Hollywood Reporter criticized it for its lack of originality calling it pretty much the poster for the first Avengers movie except with added flying robots in the background and the fact that it incorporated many of the same tropes the other MCU Phase Two film posters did These included the heroes staring off camera destruction in the background as well as something occurring in the sky and poor Photoshop on the poster highlighting the fact that each of the actors were obviously photographed separately and were later composited together into the poster 198 Mendelson agreed with many of McMillians observations and called the poster hilariously photoshopped 199 The final trailer was unlocked by fans on March 4 2015 via the use of hashtags on Twitter ahead of its broadcast debut during the series premiere of American Crime on March 5200 Mendelson felt this was a fine final trailer teasing what we already know hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling us much we dont already know adding Here we have the fourth and final Avengers Age of Ultron trailer and we dont know all that much about what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature I have expressed my concern dating back to October that Marvel and Disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and character information between October and May But if this really is the final Avengers 2 trailer then at least on the trailer front they have kept the film relatively unspoiled 201 A week after the final trailer debuted Marvel revealed that the trailer had smashed records with over 35 million views 202 In

reviews 240 CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film an A grade on an A to F scale 219 Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said Avengers Age of Ultron succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do but this time the action scenes dont always measure up 241 Scott Foundas of Variety wrote If this is what the apotheosis of branded big-studio entertainment has come to look like in 2015 we could be doing much worse Unlike its title character Age of Ultron most definitely has soul 242 Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times and giving the film three-and-a-half out of four stars Richard Roeper said Some day an Avengers film might collapse under the weight of its own awesomeness I mean how many times can they save the world But this is not that day 243 Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote Age of Ultron is a whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie It doesnt just go to 11 it starts there Joss Whedon takes a few wrong turns creating a jumble when the action gets too thick But he recovers like a pro devising a spectacle thats epic in every sense of the word 244 Conversely Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said Although this movie is effective moment to moment very little of it lingers in the mind afterward The ideal vehicle for our age of immediate sensation and instant gratification it disappears without a trace almost as soon as its consumed 245 Scott Mendelson of Forbes said Avengers Age of Ultron plays like an obligation a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move onto the things they really want to do 246 Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote This Avengers doesnt always pop the way that the first one sometimes did partly because its villain isnt as memorable despite Mr Spaders silky threat 247 Camilla Long of The Sunday Times remarked Two hours of boredom and boobs add up to a sorry basis for the new Avengers 248 Much like the release of Guardians of the Galaxy the film received mixed reviews upon release in China due to poor translations The translations which were said to be too literal were thought to have been done by Google Translate 249
