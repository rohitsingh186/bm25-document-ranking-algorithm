Many years ago when Bor ruler of Asgard was battling frost giants he followed a wounded giant to a powerful sorcerer that was waiting for him The sorcerer caught him unaware turning Bor into snow Bors son Odin found his father as he was blowing away Bor begged Odin to find a sorcerer to free him but Odin made no attempt to save his father Bor cursed Odin saying that he would take in the son of a fallen king and raise it as his own Not a week later Odin himself led the Asgardians into battle against the Frost Giants and killed Laufey who was the King in personal combat After slaying Laufey Odin found a small Asgardian-sized child hidden within the primary stronghold of the Frost Giants The child was Loki and Laufey had kept him hidden from his people due to his shame over his sons small size Odin took the boy out of a combination of pity to appease his father and because he was the son of a worthy adversary slain in honorable combat and raised him as his son alongside his biological son Thor 9 Throughout their childhood and into adolescence Loki was resentful of the differences in which he and Thor were treated by the citizens of Asgard The Asgardians valued great strength tenacity and bravery in battle above all things and Loki was clearly inferior to his foster brother Thor in those areas What he lacked in size and strength however he made up for in power and skill particularly as a sorcerer As Loki grew to adulthood his natural talent for causing mischief would make itself manifest and earned him a nickname as the God of Lies and Mischief his mischievousness eventually became malice as his hunger for power and revenge grew stronger Several times he tried to use tricks to get rid of Thor like telling him to guard a hole in the wall he had made In time his reputation grew from being a playful and mischievous trickster to the God of Evil Over the centuries Loki attempted on many occasions to seize rulership of Asgard and to destroy Thor He even helped the Storm giant Ghan to escape Thor planning to get a debt from him later and aided other enemies of Asgard planning to take over Odin who had grown weary of Lokis mischief magically imprisoned him within a tree until someone would shed a tear for him Loki eventually freed himself by causing a leaf to strike Heimdall the guardian of Bifrost in the eye which made him shed a tear Loki compiled an extensive criminal record in Asgard and was frequently exiled 10 He met the Sorcerer Eldred who taught him black magic He repaid Eldred by later giving him to the Fire demon SurturLokis schemes eventually came to include Earth itself and he often fought with Earths superhuman heroes to take their planet and often Asgard itself He first battled Thor on Earth in modern times after escaping from the tree 11 Loki then manipulated the Hulk into wreaking havoc using an illusion of dynamite on train tracks while in astral form in an attempt to lure Thor to Earth which inadvertently led to the formation of the Avengers as several other heroes came to meet the Hulk 12 Thor was one of the founding members of this superhuman team and often led them in battle against his brother Several times Loki while not directly battling Thor himself caused threats for Thor to battle like increasing the mental powers of a carnival fortune teller Sandu making him powerful enough to lift buildings with his mind 13 and releasing a Lava man called Molto by accident when he caused a long-dead volcano to explode 14 When Loki convinced Odin to punish Thor Odin took away half of Thors power after which Loki returned the memory of the 23 rd century villain Zarrko Zarkko defeated Thor and took him back to help conquer his time period although the God of Thunder was able to finally capture the villain 15 Loki even released Mr Hyde and Cobra by paying their bail then doubled their powers Loki told them to kidnap Jane Foster which he knew would attract Thors attention but they were again defeated 16 Loki finally went after Jane Foster himself sending her to another dimension However Doctor Strange was able to protect her and Thor forced Loki to return her 17 Among Lokis better known henchmen was the human criminal Carl The Crusher Creel whom Loki transformed into the superhuman criminal known as the Absorbing Man 18 Creel would prove to be a formidable adversary to Thor over the years Loki went so far as to attempt to turn Odin against Thor and to steal Thors enchanted hammer Mjolnir in an attempt to free himself but all his efforts failed When he convinced Odin to go to Earth and leave him in charge of Asgard with part of the Odinforce he released Skagg the largest Storm Giant and Surtur the huge Fire Demon to try to destroy Odin However Thor and Balder helped defeat the monsters and Loki was sent to serve the Trolls Loki was responsible for the Destroyer being awakened by leading a Hunter to the Temple where the Destroyer armor resided using his mental abilities while Thor was nearby causing the Hunters soul to animate the armor but Thor forced the Hunter to return to his body then buried the armor under thousands of tons of rock 19 The Absorbing Man was brought back to Earth by Loki and battled Thor but Loki quickly took him to Asgard when Thor was on the verge of defeating him The Absorbing Man defeated the Asgardians without too much trouble and absorbed Odins attacks However Loki and his ally were exiled into space due to a trick by Odin 20 He sent his astral form back to Earth and took over the Destroyer armor attempting to take over Asgard but Odin sent Balder to discover the location of Loki then used his powers to send Loki out of the Destroyer armor 21 Lokis destiny to be the cause of Ragnarok was later recounted 22 Loki returned from his exile in space but was then stripped of his powers and exiled to Earth by Odin Loki plotted to gain new powers from Karnilla however this accidentally created the Wrecker who gained Asgardian powers when he was mistaken for Loki after knocking him out and putting on his helmet just before Karnilla appeared in response to Lokis ritual He almost killed Thor by collapsing a building on him as Thor had been stripped of all his powers except his strength by Odin Loki then fomented a battle between Thor and the Destroyer animated by Sif 23 Loki then took command of Asgard during the Odinsleep using his right as the son of Odin before Thor could claim it but fled when Asgard was invaded by Mangog as he realized that this new foe was too powerful 24 Loki later usurped the throne of Asgard by taking the Odinring but fled again when Asgard was invaded by Surtur 25 He subsequently attempted to destroy Thor by switching bodies with him leaving him with Thors raw strength against Thors inexperienced use of his magic but Thor was able to regain his true appearance by tricking Loki into throwing Mjolnir away so that it became stuck in a cliff causing Thors body to return to the form of Donald Blake and allowing Thor to regain control of his true form 26 Much later Loki usurped the throne of Asgard again and set the Destroyer against Thor once more 27 Shortly after that Loki caused the temporary death of Balder using mistletoe as he had conspired with Hela to cause Ragnarok if his last plan failed At this time Lokis estranged wife Sigyn returned to Asgard When Loki was chained and a viper dripped poison onto his face as punishment for killing Balder Sigyn tried helping him Loki attempted to bring about Ragnarok but was foiled by Odin 28 Alongside Tyr and his forces Loki stole the golden apples of Idunna and invaded Asgard with help from the Midgard serpent but then changed sides and aided Odins forces in defeating Tyr 29 Despite Lokis hatred of his foster brother and father Loki helped to defend Asgard from destruction from Surtur and his fire demons This was because Surturs goal was to destroy Asgard whereas Loki sought only to rule it Alongside Odin and Thor Loki battled Surtur and witnessed the seeming demise of Odin 30 Not long after that Loki transformed Thor into a frog for a time using the Twilight Sword Thor was turned back when Volstagg destroyed one of the machines Loki had used to transform Thor 31 He then involved the X-Men and Alpha Flight in a plot to gain favor with Those Who Sit Above in Shadow by trying to prove that he could do a truly good deed by offering to grant the wishes of the two teams - such as giving Puck a normal body while granting Rogue the ability to touch again - but he failed the test because he tried to force the gifts on the heroes after they rejected them the two teams learning that these enhanced powers - and the further powers that Loki would grant to the world - would deprive those who received the gifts of the ability to imagine and create new things essentially destroying what it meant to be human 32 In disguise Loki manipulated a group of master villains into engineering the Acts of Vengeance With these prime movers he set in motion a plot against the Avengers and other heroes He sent the Juggernaut against Thor and cast a spell that caused temporary bouts of weakness in Thor He battled the combined forces of the West Coast and East Coast Avengers His identity was ultimately revealed and he was defeated by the Avengers 333435 Loki would actually die at the hands of Thor 36 although manipulation of the time stream would later bring him back 37 Morwen a powerful agent of chaos was released and took Tessa Black a child of Loki as a host With Doctor Strange unavailable Loki and Spider-Man work together to free her Loki proclaims he owes an as yet unpaid debt to his temporary ally 38 A short while later Loki was prophesied to lead Asgards enemies into destroying the Eternal Realm in a final conflict known as Ragnark part of the continuing Asgardian cycle of the birth life and death presided over by beings known as Those Who Sit Above in Shadow who drew sustenance from the energies expended during these cycles In the final confrontation between the brothers before that battle Thor hung Lokis head from his belt so he could watch the final moments of the battle 39 After Ragnark Loki returned in a female body working with Doctor Doom so Thor would unwittingly resurrect his Asgardian enemies 40 and manipulated Balder to make him the new successor to the throne of Asgard 41 In reality Loki retained his male form after Ragnarok but hid himself inside Thors reborn lover Sif During this period Hela and Loki used magic to send Loki to the past to cause the events that led to his younger self being adopted by Odin as a means to eliminate Bor Thors grandfather 42 During the Secret Invasion Loki goaded the Asgardians into believing Beta Ray Bill was a Skrull but Thor showed that Loki was lying 43 After the Skrulls were defeated she joined the Cabal consisting of herself Norman Osborn Emma Frost Doctor Doom Namor and the Hood 44 so Osborn could launch his new world order promising Loki Asgard back in the heavens where it belonged 45 Loki and Sif are soon restored to their respective bodies 46 and following the Hoods depowerment Loki offers him a second chance 47 The Scarlet Witch appeared in her astral form recruiting a team of Avengers to face the Elder God Chthon 48 It was soon revealed that Wanda was Loki in disguise The Avengers unaware of Lokis trick followed the false Wandas instructions 49 Her goal was to throw Norman Osborn off balance as shown during the second meeting of the Cabal After Thor was banished due to her trickery Loki intended to put cracks in Osborns armor and gradually widen these cracks through the Mighty Avengers Pietro Maximoff desiring to see and converse with his sister joined the Mighty Avengers He raced around the world searching for her not knowing that his nephews Billy and Tommy had just done so and also failed to find her 50 However Loki had planned on the deaths of Pietro and Cassandra Lang fearing they may be wedges in her plans She cut off communications from the former and tried to convince Hank Pym to expel Cassie after placing a spell on her to prevent her from saying anything bad about her disguise The latter however invited her fellow Young Avengers into the Infinite Avengers Mansion an extension of the PymPocket to prove that the Scarlet Witch was evil When Wiccan cast a spell to bring Scarlet Witch to them Loki appeared as Scarlet Witch and stated that Cassandra Lang sealed their fate Just then Ronin appeared and ambushed the Scarlet Witch 51 He determined that she was not Wanda by kissing her and stating that the real Scarlet Witch would have used her power to revive Cassandras father Wiccan then chanted a spell to reveal her true form Afraid of exposure Loki was forced to leave swearing all their deaths 52 The continued achievements of the Mighty Avengers strained Osborn to the breaking point Loki decided to play the final card that would break Osborn by unleashing the Absorbing Man who had absorbed the power of the Cosmic Cube 53 In the Dark Avengers Loki was in Norman Osborns office and manipulated him into becoming the Green Goblin again as Siege begins 54 Loki was present at the Cabal when Norman Osborn denied to bring Namor to Doctor Doom When the Doombot posing as Doctor Doom unleashed insect-like robots Loki advised the Hood to take flight Following Osborns talk with the President Loki advised to recreate an incident similar to the Stamford Incident that would bring about the invasion upon Asgard 5556 He then revealed a plot to Osborn that would take advantage of Volstaggs presence in Chicago Since Volstagg had gone for adventures like Thor the U-Foes could attack him and destroy a packed Soldier Field during an American football game killing thousands while he and Osborn watch in astral form Loki then warned Balder about Osborns impending attack on Asgard and claimed he tried to convince Osborn not to attack 5758 He killed an Asgardian who prophesied the attack and sends Heimdalls chamber beneath Asgard 59 so he couldnt warn the Asgardians in time Loki when Osborn called out to him for their aid sent the Hood and his syndicate as reinforcements to help Osborns forces against the Avengers 6061 Loki later appeared to Balder telling him that he would have simply pardoned Thor instead of banishing him if he had not wanted the throne of Asgard for himself Balder later banished Loki from Asgard 62 Some time after he magically disguised himself as Osborns Green Goblin persona to lay siege to Asgard Loki encountered the Disir the Valkyries of Bor after he lured them using several wandering gods souls he imprisoned as bait revealing that he desired to gain their service as his slaves The 13 Disir unite and assault him as one but Loki managed to defeat them using extraordinary swordsmanship skills thus forcing them to submit to him and declare him the victor Loki meets with Hela and asks her what she will give in exchange for a new Hel to which she answers Anything He meets with Mephisto demonstrating the power of the Disir and agreeing to lend him the Disir for a hundred and one days in exchange for the demon lord granting a portion of his netherworld to Hela for one thousand and one years as her new Hel which Mephisto agrees to In exchange for this Hela erased Loki from the Books of Hel thus he was no longer tied to Hel or Asgard gaining absolute freedom Mephisto asked Loki why he had resorted to such schemes to which Loki replied it was more fun this way 6364 When the combined forces of the New Avengers Young Avengers and the Secret Warriors defeated the Dark Avengers Thor demanded to know where Loki was Norman Osborn could only tell him that he was dead just like the rest of them as the true form of the Void appeared 6061 As the creature tore apart the three teams Loki began to repent realizing that what had happened to Asgard was not what he wanted He begged his father Odin to return to him the Norn Stones which were taken away from the Hood and given to the trickster He used their power to empower the three teams and give the powers of the Hoods gang to them and fight back against the Void However the Void sensed Lokis hand in this and attacked him the stones not affecting him directly As Loki was torn apart by the Voids tendrils in front of a shocked Thor his last words were to apologize to his brother Thor resolved to avenge his fallen brother and destroyed the Void and the Sentry with a lightning strike He took the Sentrys remains into outer space and released them into the Sun 6566 Thor missing his brother searched for Loki who had returned to life in the form of a young boy as his schemes had his name removed from the Book of Hel allowing him to permanently cheat death Now located in Paris France Loki was a street hustler going by the name of Serrure the French word for lock who feigned simple card tricks in front of an audience while an accomplice pickpocketed them Thor in civilian disguise gave chase resulting in the restoration of Lokis memory but not of his past life with the exception of a guilty conscience for things he cannot remember With nothing to lose Loki followed Thor who restored part of his identity to him though he remains in the form of a child and asked when Thor got so old to which Thor smiled 67 Thor took Loki to the remains of Asgard where plans were made to help the refugees of the World Tree 68 With the resurrection of Odin Loki was frightened away and fled with Thor who lambasted Odin for scaring him away Running into Iron Man Loki was saved by Thor who defended his own reasons for bringing the trickster back 69 With the Asgardian population other than Thor still wary of Loki Loki revealed to his brother that he was attempting to learn more about Earth and humans to which Thor approves When a magpie exploded in his quarters carrying a key it led to a chain of events where at the end Loki was contacted by an echo of his former incarnation who revealed he chose to sacrifice himself fighting the Void as part of a greater plan which would involve his death and return The child Loki refused to follow this path wanting to be his own person and transformed the spirit of his former self into a magpie named Ikol On returning to Earth he witnessed Odin striking down Thor 70 Odin prepared all of Asgard for an unknown battle and imprisoned Thor for attempting to protect Midgard from being scoured Loki who disagreed with Odins actions was put to work by Volstagg into cleaning the stables of Thors goats to keep him out of trouble and danger Using the wool of one of the goats Loki descended into the roots of the World Tree at the advice of Ikol to ask questions from the Nornish women who live there After receiving his answers Loki wept but decided to turn to the imprisoned Thor for his opinion before making his final decision Breaking into the prison by stealth Loki asked his brother what he would do if he had to let something bad happen in order to prevent something worse from happening and what if it cost him everything With Thors answer Loki decided to free one of the imprisoned Hel Wolves and bind it to him in servitude using the bridle of Thors goats He revealed he needed help from one more personage before heading for the realm of Hela 71 Having recovered Thors hammer after he was killed and erased from memory following the war against the Serpent Loki was able to work with the Silver Surfer to restore the hammer to its natural state and send it to Thor in the afterlife restoring his memory and allowing him to fight his way back into the realm of the living 72 After Thors return Ikol would afterwards reveal that circumstances had been manipulated to force the young Loki to allow his former personality to subsume him and live again his former slate wiped clean by the new Lokis actions 73 During his adventures the young Loki had inadvertently helped create and was tied to a powerful artifact that was about to be used by Mephisto to conquer all the Hells and ultimately everything 74 However if the new Loki ceased to be the artifact would lose all power Seeing no other option Loki allowed Ikol to become Loki again ceasing to be but he warned beforehand that the Ikol personality was incapable of true change and believed this older persona would ultimately be stopped by those who always stopped him before his brother included 73 Kid Loki joined the Young Avengers in the 2013 relaunch of the series as part of Marvel NOW 75 When Wiccan and Hulkling are captured by an interdimensional parasite known as Mother Loki comes to their aid and rescues them from the prison that they were being held in

into Mystery and is convinced to return to the team Once there he defeats the creature but the team is forced to leave New York as Wiccans spell is still intact 79 While the rest of the team is busy Loki meets with Mother revealing that he had planned everything that had happened with the parasite working in order to gain access to Wiccans immense power so that he can gain back the abilities he lost when he was reincarnated 80 The team is left in a situation where neither Wiccan nor Loki are powerful enough to fight Mother In order to increase Lokis power Wiccan ages Lokis body to that of a teenager increasing his powers 81 Now able to take on Mother as well as Leah who had recruited the exes of the other Young Avengers members the group goes to Mothers dimension to stop things once and
