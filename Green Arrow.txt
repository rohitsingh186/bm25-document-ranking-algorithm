November 1941 His real name is Oliver Queen a billionaire businessman and owner of Queen Industries also a well-known celebrity in his locale of Star City 2 Sometimes shown dressed like Robin Hood Green Arrow is an archer who uses his skills to fight crime in his home cities of Star City and Seattle as well as alongside his fellow superheroes as a member of the Justice League Though much less frequently used in modern stories he also deploys a range of trick arrows with various special functions such as glue explosive-tipped grappling hook flash grenade tear gas and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations At the time of his debut Green Arrow functioned in many ways as an archery-themed analogue of the very popular Batman character but writers at DC subsequently developed him into a voice of progressivism very much distinct in character from BatmanGreen Arrow enjoyed moderate success in his early years becoming the cover feature of More Fun as well as having occasional appearances in other comics Throughout his first twenty-five years however the character never enjoyed greater popularity In the late 1960 s writer Denny ONeil inspired by the characters dramatic visual redesign by Neal Adams chose to have him lose his fortune giving him the then-unique role of a streetwise crusader for the working class and the disadvantaged In 1970 he was paired with a more law and order-oriented hero Green Lantern in a ground-breaking socially conscious comic book series 3 Since then he has been popular among comic book fans and most writers have taken an urban gritty approach to the character The character was killed off in the 1990 s and replaced by a new character Olivers son Connor Hawke Connor however proved a less popular character and the original Oliver Queen character was resurrected in the 2001 Quiver storyline by writer Kevin Smith In the 2000 s the character has been featured in bigger storylines focusing on Green Arrow and Black Canary such as the DC event The Green ArrowBlack Canary Wedding and the high-profile Justice League Cry for Justice storyline prior to the characters relaunch alongside most of DCs properties in 2011 Green Arrow was not initially a well-known character outside of comic book fandom he had appeared in a single episode of the animated series Super Friends in 1973 In the 2000 s the character appeared in a number of DC television properties including the animated series Justice League Unlimited Young Justice The Batman and Batman The Brave and the Bold and several DC Universe Animated Original

character is portrayed by Stephen Amell earning positive reviews 4 Green Arrow and Speedy first appeared in More Fun Comics 73 cover-dated November 1941 which was illustrated by artist George Papp When Mort Weisinger was creating the character aside from the obvious allusions to Robin Hood took inspiration from a movie serial The Green Archer based on the novel by Edgar Wallace He retooled the concept into a superhero archer with obvious Batman influences 5 These include Green Arrows sidekick Speedy his use of an Arrowcar and Arrow-Plane for transportation his use of an Arrow-Cave as his headquarters his alter ego as a billionaire playboy the use of an Arrow-Signal to summon him as well as a clown-like arch foe named Bulls Eye similar to Batmans arch-foe the JokerAnother Weisinger-created character Aquaman also appeared for the first time in that issue These two back-up features continued to run concurrently in More Fun Comics until the mid-1940 s as well as then in Adventure Comics between 1946 and 1960 Green Arrow and Speedy also appeared in various issues of Worlds Finest Comics until issue 140 1964 The Green Arrow and Speedy feature was one of five back-up features to be promoted in one of the earliest team-up books Leading ComicsGreen Arrow was one of the few DC characters to keep going after the Golden Age of Comic Books The longevity of the character was due to the influence of creator Mort Weisinger who kept Green Arrow and Aquaman as back-up features to the headlining Superboy feature first in More Fun Comics and then Adventure Comics Aside from sharing Adventure Comics with him issue 258 featured an encounter between a younger Oliver Queen and Superboy The Green Arrow and Speedy feature during this period included a short run in 1958 written by Dick and Dave Wood and drawn by Jack Kirby For much of this period Green Arrows adventures were written by France Herron who was the characters primary scripter 194719636 In 1969 artist Neal Adams updated the characters visual appearance by giving him a Van Dyke beard and costume of his own design in The Brave and the Bold 85 AugustSeptember 19697 Writer Dennis ONeil followed up on Green Arrows new appearance by completely remaking the characters attitude in Justice League of America 75 cover-dated November 1969 having Oliver Queen lose his fortune and become an outspoken advocate of the underprivileged and the political left wing The story also turned teammate Black Canary into a love interest for Queen 8 In the early 1970 s Green Arrow became a co-feature with Green Lantern Hal Jordan in an acclaimed series of stories by ONeil and Adams that dealt with various social and political issues The two co-stars served to represent contrasting sociopolitical viewpoints Green Arrow spoke for radical change while Green Lantern was an establishment liberal figure wanting to work within existing institutions of government and law 8 Queen convinces Jordan to see beyond his strict obedience to the Green Lantern Corps to help those who were neglected or discriminated against ONeil explained He would be a hot-tempered anarchist to contrast with the cerebral sedate model citizen who was Green Lantern 9 The duo embark on a quest in a beat-up pickup truck to find America along the way witnessing the problems of corruption racism pollution as well as overpopulation confronting the nation One story in issues 78-79 was even widely interpreted as an allegory for the Manson Family cult murders though ONeil has emphasized that the story was about the authoritarian left and not Manson 8 In Green Lantern vol 2 8586 it is revealed that Green Arrows ward Speedy is addicted to heroin 2 Speedy overcomes his addiction with the help of the Black Canary This story prompted a massive public reaction including a congratulatory letter from the mayor of New York John Lindsay 8 However Green Lantern sales had been in a major decline at the time Green Arrow was brought on as co-star and the ONeilAdams stories failed to revive them 8 Green Lantern was canceled with issue 89 AprilMay 1972 and the climactic story arc of the Green LanternGreen Arrow series was published as a back-up feature in The Flash 217 through 219 In sharp contrast to the socially relevant tales which preceded it this story centered on emotional themes with Green Arrow struggling to deal with the guilt of having killed a man 8 Afterwards Green Arrow began appearing in solo stories run as backups in Action Comics starting with 421 Elliot S Maggin who had coincidentally made his comics debut with a Green Arrow story published in Green Lantern vol 2 87 was Green Arrows writer for the next several years 8 In 1976 the Green LanternGreen Arrow title was re-launched without the socially conscious themes of

original Seven Soldiers of Victory superhero team recovered by the Justice League and Justice Society After the Crisis the Earth-Two Green Arrow and Speedy were retconned out of existence altogether given the end of DCs former multiverseIn 1987 DC Comics launched the character into a new ongoing title as part of their mature audience comic line Written and illustrated by Mike Grell the revamp was launched with Green Arrow The Longbow Hunters mini-series 11 In this three-issue prestige format limited series a routine adventure against a group of drug runners led to tragedy as the Black Canary was captured and brutally tortured In response Oliver murders his girlfriends attackers The mini-series would also introduce the enigmatic female Japanese archer Shado whose family had suffered in a World War II internment camp Shado would later rape Oliver 12 and become pregnant by him producing a son named Robert after his father 13 Under Grell Green Arrow would abandon the use of his trademark gadget arrows and relocate from Star City to Seattle Washington As the series was part of DC Comics mature audience line it took on a more gritty violent as well as urban tone with Green Arrow often using deadly force against his enemies Grell wrote the series for the first 80 issues downplaying the super-hero aspects of the characters Oliver abandoned his mask and was never actually referred to as Green Arrow and Black Canary was never shown using her sonic scream power Sometimes this was explained as having lost it due to the events of The Longbow Hunters though this was not consistent with her appearances in other titles published during this period While crossover specials were conceived to allow other writers most notably Denny ONeil who wrote Batman and the mature audience comic The Question to use Green Arrow Grell wrote him as largely isolated from the rest of the DC Universe when other DC characters like longtime friend Hal Jordan aka Green Lantern appeared they did so in street clothes and used only their civilian names 14 In place of the super-hero community Grell created his own supporting cast In addition to Shado Grell introduced Seattle police Lieutenant Jim Cameron who was disgusted with Green Arrows vigilante actions including killing criminals renegade CIA agent Greg Osborne who began to monitor Queens activities as well as mercenary Eddie Fyers initially introduced as Queens adversary but later to become a companion of necessity when Green Arrow was forced to leave Seattle after false accusations of aiding terrorists Grells run ended with

of rebelling against his responsibilities During his first adventure in Star City Oliver meets an old flame Brianna Stone a former college radical who warns him if he continued to carry his bow he would one day have to use it for real Grells limited series also established Queens attraction toward dangerous womenOnce Grell left the series DC almost immediately began restoring Green Arrow to the mainstream DC Universe His ongoing series mostly written by Kelley Puckett and drawn by artist Jim Aparo was removed from the Mature Audience line which had evolved into Vertigo with 63 prior to Grells departure and Green Arrow began appearing in various super-hero titles as a guest most notably Green Lantern 47 which had Oliver aiding Green Lantern in rescuing his longtime girlfriend Carol Ferris and her family from one of Hals enemies as well as the 1994 DC Comics mini-series Zero Hour In Zero Hour Queen is forced to shoot his old friend at a pivotal moment Now tightly integrated in

WagnerIn Green Arrow 100101 Oliver would infiltrate a group of eco-terrorists known as the Eden Corps and sacrifice his life in order to prevent the group from detonating a bomb that would destroy the city of Metropolis 2 the resulting explosion completely atomising Queens body so that his identity could only be confirmed by Superman witnessing his death This allowed the writers to shake up the status quo by making Connor Hawke a replacement Green Arrow The series now written by Chuck Dixon would continue with Hawke as the main focus until issue 137 when the series was canceledIn 2000 Oliver Queen is revived in a new series Green Arrow vol 3 in the story arc Quiver written by Kevin Smith and illustrated by Phil Hester and Ande Parks It is revealed that Hals resurrection of Oliver seen on the very last page of Green Arrow 137 the final issue of the OliverConnor ongoing series was in reality a deliberately flawed one In Hals final hours before sacrificing his life to save the Earth during The Final Night Hal speaks with Olivers soul in the afterlife The two agree to bring back a version of Oliver Queen one without a soul so Oliver may properly stay in Heaven and with no memory of the events of The Longbow Hunters mini-series or of the subsequent events that followed up until his death Oliver reasoning that things went wrong for him after the events that drove him to kill for the first time and feeling that the copy of him was restored at the best point in his lifeFor some years this resurrected Oliver lives in Star City as a vigilante hero completely under the radar of his other superhero friends but eventually he is discovered and learns the truth of his resurrection leaving the resurrected Oliver feeling uncertain about his state now that he knows he has no soul His resurrection is eventually used by the grandfather of Stanley Dover in an attempt to gain power over the monster that Dover accidentally bound to his grandson Dover intending to take Olivers body- possible only due to his lack of a soul- and use his access to the JLAs resources to find the monster At the climax of the story Olivers soul returns from heaven re-inhabits his resurrected earthly form and helps his son Connor Hawke fight a horde of demons the body of Oliver having made contact with his soul and convincing him to return to save their son Dover is defeated and actually consumed by the Beast who then leaves of his own accord Oliver also finds himself independently wealthy again as Dover had transferred all his financial assets to Oliver in anticipation of taking over his body He also picked up a new sidekick Mia Dearden who would become the new Speedy under Olivers tutelage 15 After the resurrection storyline Smith wrote a second and shorter arc involving a super-powered serial killer calling himself Onomatopoeia who sought to claim Connor as his latest victim Smith then left the title and Brad Meltzer took over as writerMeltzers single storyline for Green Arrow featured Oliver and his former sidekick Roy Harper reuniting and going on a cross-country road trip to pick up old possessions of Olivers most notably a spare Green Lantern power ring entrusted to him by Hal Jordan many years earlier The story also revealed that Oliver knew all along that Connor was his son and was even present at his birth but that Oliver ultimately abandoned Connor and his mother because of his fear of the responsibilities of fatherhood Meltzers storyline would continue into the mini-series Green Lantern Rebirth which featured Olivers attempts to use the ring against Sinestro- presumed dead for several years- before the ring is reclaimed by the reborn Hal JordanMeltzer went on to write the mini-series Identity Crisis which heavily featured Green Arrow as one of the storys main characters investigating the murder of Sue Dibny- the wife of the Elongated Man- and revealing that the League had been involved in mind-wiping various villains in the past
