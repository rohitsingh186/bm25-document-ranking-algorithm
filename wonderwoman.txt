In 2013 Warner Bros announced that actress Gal Gadot would portray Wonder Woman in the 2016 film Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice marking the characters feature film debut after over 70 years of history 9 Wonder Woman has used the alias Diana Prince created by William Moulton Marston as her secret identityDuring Marstons run Diana Prince was the name of an army nurse whom Wonder Woman met The nurse wanted to meet her fianc who was transferred to South America but was unable to arrange for money to do so As Wonder Woman needed a secret identity to monitor and look after Steve who was admitted in the same army hospital Diana Prince worked at and because both of them looked a lot like each other Wonder Woman gave the nurse money to go to her fianc in exchange for the nurses credentials and took Diana Prince as her alias 37 She started to work as an army nurse and later as an Air Force secretary 37112 The identity of Diana Prince was especially prominent in a series published in the 1960 s in which she fought crime only under the Prince alias and without her mystic powers To support herself she ran a mod clothing boutique 4445 The Diana Prince alias also played an important role after the events of Infinite Crisis Wonder Woman was broadcast worldwide killing a villain named Maxwell Lord as he was mind controlling Superman into killing Batman When Wonder Woman caught him in her lasso demanding to know how to stop Superman Maxwell revealed that the only way to stop him was to kill Lord so as a last resort Diana snapped his neck 113114 To recover from the trauma of killing another person the Amazon went into a self-imposed exile for one year 115 On her return to public life Diana realized that her life as a full-time celebrity superhero and ambassador had kept her removed from humanity Because of this she assumed the persona of Diana Prince and became an agent at the Department of Metahuman Affairs During a later battle with the witch Circe a spell was placed on Diana leaving her powerless when not in the guise of Wonder Woman 116 In the current New 52 universe Diana does not have a secret identity as stated in an interview by series writer Brian Azzarello 117 However when she and Superman began dating for her civilian identity she uses the Diana Prince alias whenever she is around Clark Kent such as when she introduced herself to Lois Lane at Loiss housewarming party under that name 118 Diana is depicted as a masterful athlete acrobat fighter and strategist trained and experienced in many ancient and modern forms of armed and unarmed combat including exclusively Amazonian martial arts In some versions her mother trained her as Wonder Girl for a future career as Wonder Woman From the beginning she is portrayed as highly skilled in using her Amazon bracelets to stop bullets and in wielding her golden lasso 147 Batman once called her the best melee fighter in the world 148 The modern version of the character is known to use lethal force when she deems it necessary 149 In The New 52 continuity her superior combat skills are the result of her amazon training as well as receiving further training from Ares The God War himself since as early as her childhood 100 The Golden Age Wonder Woman also had knowledge in psychology as did her Amazon sistersDiana has an arsenal of powerful god-forged weapons at her disposal but her signature weapons are her indestructible bracelets and the Lasso of TruthThe Golden Age Wonder Woman had strength that was comparable to the Golden Age Superman Wonder Woman was capable of bench pressing 15000 pounds even before shed earned her bracelets and later hoisted a 50000 pound boulder above her head to inspire amazons facing the test 128 Another example of her great strength was when she was able to tear a steel door off its hinges 129 In one of her earliest appearances she is shown running easily at 60 mph and later jumps from a building and lands on the balls of her feet 130 She was able to heal faster than a normal human being due to her birthright consumption of water from Paradise Islands Fountain of Eternal YouthHer strength would be removed in accordance with Aphrodites Law if she allowed her bracelets to be bound or chained by a male 131 She also had an array of mental and psychic abilities as corresponding to Dr Marstons interest in parapsychology and mysticism Such an array included ESP astral projection telepathy with or without the Mental Radio mental control over the electricity in her body the Amazonian ability to turn brain energy into muscle power etc 132 Wonder Woman first became immune to electric shocks after having her spirit stripped from her atoms by Dr Psychos Electro Atomizer it was also discovered that she was unable to send a mental radio message without her body 133 Wonder Woman vol 1 105 revealed that Diana was formed from clay by the Queen of the Amazons and was imbued with the attributes of the Greek and Roman gods by Athena  beautiful as Aphrodite wise as Athena swifter than Hermes and stronger than Hercules 20 Wonder Womans Amazon training gave her limited telepathy profound scientific knowledge 20 and the ability to speak every language known to man and beyond  even caveman 20134 and Martian language 134 Between 1966 and 1967 new powers were added such as super breath and telepathy 135 In the Silver and Bronze ages of comics Wonder Woman was able to further increase her strength In times of great need removing her bracelets would temporarily augment her power tenfold but cause her to go insane in the process 136 These powers received changes after the events of Crisis on Infinite EarthsIn the Post-Crisis universe Wonder Woman receives her powers as a blessing from Olympian deities 137 Demeter the goddess of agriculture and fertility blessed Diana with strength drawn from the Earth spirit Gaea making her one of the physically strongest heroes in the DC Universe and the strongest female heroine of all in the DC Universe Although nowDiana is currently the daughter of Zeus king of the Greek Gods so its unclear as to how much of her power and strength is a direct result of her divine heritage 138 Her connection to the earth allows her to heal at an accelerated rate so long as she is in contact with the planet However as mentioned earlier now that she is a Demigoddess its been suggested that she heals extremely quickly also due to her divine heritage In rare cases where she has been gravely injured Diana showed the ability to physically merge with the earth causing whatever injuries or poisons to be expelled from her body such an act is considered sacred and can only be used in extreme cases 139 Pallas Athena the goddess of wisdom and war granted Diana great wisdom intelligence and military prowess Athenas gift has enabled Diana to master over a dozen languages including those of alien origin multiple complex crafts sciences and philosophies as well as leadership military strategy and armed and unarmed combat More recently Athena bound her own eyesight to Dianas granting her increased empathy 140 Artemis goddess of the hunt animals and the Moon graced Diana with the Eyes of the Hunter and unity with beasts The Eyes of the Hunter ability gives Diana a full range of enhanced senses including telescopic vision and super hearingHestia goddess of hearth and home granted Diana sisterhood with fire This power has been shown to control the Fires of Truth which Diana wields through her lasso making anyone bound by it unable to lie 141 This ability also grants her resistance to both normal and supernatural fireHermes the messenger god of speed granted Diana superhuman speed and the ability to fly 141 She is capable of flying at speeds approaching half the speed of light 139 She can react quickly enough to deflect bullets lasers and other projectiles with her virtually impenetrable bracelets After the 2011 relaunch of the character Wonder Woman does not naturally possess the power of flight She gains it once she is hit by a feather thrown by Hermes 142143 better source neededAphrodite goddess of love bestowed Diana with stunning beauty as well as a kind heartWhile not invulnerable she is highly resistant to great amounts of concussive force and extreme temperatures Edged weapons or projectiles applied with sufficient force though are able to pierce her skin 139144 Due to her divine origins Diana can resist many forms of magical manipulationShe is able to astrally project herself into various lands of myth Her physical body reacts to whatever happens to her on the mythical astral plane leaving her body cut bruised or sometimes strengthened once her mind and body are reunited She can apparently leave the planet through meditation and did this once to rescue Artemis while she was in hell 145 After the 2011 relaunch Diana has gained new powers As the natural born daughter of Hippolyta and Zeus she has inherited some of her fathers powers which are suppressed by wearing her bracelets She uses these powers in battle against Artemis the Goddess not the Amazon and quickly renders her unconscious with ease with a series of carefully positioned counterattacks While using her godly strength her costume and accoutrements lit up and her eyes glowed like her fathers 146143 better source needed After becoming the God of War in the pages of Wonder Woman Diana inherits his divine abilities Diana has not exhibited her full powers as War but is seen in SupermanWonder Woman 5 to slip easily into telepathic rapport with a soldier explaining I am War I know all soldiers and they know me
